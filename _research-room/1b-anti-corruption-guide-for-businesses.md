A clean business protects a company and employees from being caught in thorny and compromising situations. As part of the CPIBâ€™s commitment to combat corruption in the private sector, we have developed ***PACT: A Practical Anti-Corruption Guide for Businesses in Singapore*** to help domestic business owners prevent corruption in their companies.

PACT provides useful facts on corruption in Singapore, an easily-implementable anti-corruption framework, private sector case studies and other useful anti-corruption resources.

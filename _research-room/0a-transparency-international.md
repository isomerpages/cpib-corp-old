### **About Transparency International**

Transparency International (TI) is an international non-governmental organization set up to tackle the issue of corruption around the world. It is present in more than 100 countries and works with partners in government, business and civil society to put effective measures in place to tackle corruption. TI publishes an annual ***Corruption Perceptions Index and Global Corruption Barometer***, a comparative listing of corruption worldwide.

### **About the Corruption Perceptions Index**

First launched in 1995, the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) by TI has been widely credited with putting the issue of corruption on the international policy agenda. Using expert assessments and opinion surveys, the CPI measures and ranks countries and territories based on the perceived levels of public sector corruption. The 2018 index draws upon 13 expert assessments and surveys of business people.

### **Around the World**

The CPI currently ranks 180 countries on a scale from 100 (very clean) to 0 (highly corrupt). Below is a world map showing the results of the 2020 CPI. High numbers (yellow) indicate lower perception of corruption, whereas lower numbers (red) indicate higher perception of corruption.

Topping the 2020 CPI list is Denmark and New Zealand, which are at joint first place respectively.

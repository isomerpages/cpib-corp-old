The Singapore Standard (SS) ISO 37001 on anti-bribery management systems is a voluntary standard designed to help companies establish, implement, maintain and improve their anti-bribery compliance programmes. It includes a series of measures which represents globally recognised anti-bribery good practice that companies can implement.The following are some benefits from the adoption of SS ISO 37001:

* Assists a company in implementing an anti-bribery management system, or in enhancing its existing controls, with the potential to reduce corporate risk and costs related to bribery.
* Helps provide assurance to the management and owners of an company, and to its funders, customers and other business associates, that the company has implemented internationally recognised good practice anti-bribery controls.
* Helps in the event of an investigation to provide evidence to the prosecutors or courts that the company had taken reasonable steps to prevent bribery

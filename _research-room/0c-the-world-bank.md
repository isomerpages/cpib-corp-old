### **About the Worldwide Governance Indicators**

The Worldwide Governance Indicators is based on a long-standing research programme of The World Bank and was first established in 1996 to measure the quality of governance in over 200 countries. These aggregate indicators are derived from over 30 individual data sources produced by a variety of survey institutes, think tanks, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and private sector firms.

The indicators capture six key dimensions of governance which include the control of corruption. According to The World Bank, corruption is the single greatest obstacle to economic and social development.

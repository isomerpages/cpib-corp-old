**𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐨𝐧 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐜𝐚𝐦𝐬 𝐈𝐧𝐯𝐨𝐥𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐂𝐏𝐈𝐁**

The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) is aware of recent impersonation scams involving the Bureau.

On one occasion, the CPIB has been notified that a member of public has received a call purportedly from the CPIB. The caller had requested for the individual’s bank account details. CPIB would like to clarify that the call was not made by our officer. The CPIB will not request for confidential details such as individuals’ bank credentials over the phone.

On a separate unrelated incident, a Member of Public has received a request to follow a fake CPIB TikTok account which borne the CPIB logo.  CPIB does not have a TikTok account. The imposter account has been removed.

Members of the public are advised to adopt the following precautions if they receive such calls or unexpected requests from social media accounts which may be dubious in nature:

a) Call CPIB’s hotline at 1800-376-0000 for assistance to verify the authenticity of the calls or unexpected requests from social media accounts purported to be CPIB.
b) Do not remit or transfer any money for any transactions based on instructions which the calls or purported accounts are asking for.
c) Refrain from providing personal information such as your One-Time Password (OTP) and bank credentials to the requestor.

CPIB takes a serious view of the impersonation of public agencies for undesirable or scam purposes. If you have any information on suspected scams based on the impersonation of CPIB or its officers, please call the CPIB hotline at 1800-376-0000, the Police hotline at 1800-255-0000, or submit it online at www.police.gov.sg/iwitness.

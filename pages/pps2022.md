**CPIB PUBLIC PERCEPTION SURVEY 2022**

The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) is conducting a **Public Perception Survey** to find out the general public’s awareness and perception of the corruption situation in Singapore and CPIB’s anti-corruption work. **The survey will be carried out from August to September 2022.** 

An independent market research agency, **Media Research Consultants Pte Ltd (MRC)** has been appointed to conduct the survey during the mentioned period. All interviewers will bear an **authorisation letter** issued by the CPIB and the **MRC interviewer pass** which includes the interviewer’s name and photograph.

Your responses will be kept strictly confidential. If you wish to verify that MRC is commissioned by the CPIB to conduct the survey, you may call the CPIB Quality Service Manager hotline at 1800 270-0855.

We appreciate your support and participation. Thank you.

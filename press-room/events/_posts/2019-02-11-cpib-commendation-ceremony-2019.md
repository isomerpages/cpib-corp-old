On 11 February 2019, CPIB held a commendation ceremony at the Corruption Reporting & Heritage Centre. The ceremony saw 13 individuals, from both the public and private sectors, commended for rejecting bribes. Four police officers as well as several from various private companies were amongst those commended for standing up to the scourge of corruption. Director CPIB Mr Denis Tang presented plaques to the recipients for their acts of integrity and lauded them for being fine examples of honesty and righteousness. He added that Singapore cannot afford to be complacent as corruption comes with tremendous negative repercussions and costs to Singapore’s economic development and social mobility. Director CPIB also encouraged the public to reject and report acts of corruption if they come across any. These men and women had displayed values of integrity, honesty and professionalism and are an inspiration in Singapore’s relentless fight against corruption.

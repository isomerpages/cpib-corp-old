In conjunction with International Anti-Corruption Day on 9 December, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) held a commendation ceremony to commend and recognise 18 individuals who have stood up to the scourge of corruption when they rejected bribes.

The ceremony was held on 8 December 2017, at the Corruption Reporting & Heritage Centre. For their act of honesty and integrity, these individuals were presented with a plaque by Director CPIB Mr Wong Hong Kuan.

Hailing from the public and private sectors of Singapore, these men and women exemplify good values that will put our nation in good stead. Their unwavering determination against the venal is an inspiration for all of us.

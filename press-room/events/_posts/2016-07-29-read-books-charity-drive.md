In 2016, CPIB embarked on some new initiatives that go beyond oneâ€™s wallet to show care and concern towards the less fortunate.

One of them is the Read-for-Books Charity Drive. Organized by the National Library Board (NLB) in their drive to promote the National Reading Movement, NLB had paired the movement up with corporate social responsibility and extended this to all the public agencies. By having 10 people read together for 15 minutes, 1 book will be donated to children from KidsREAD. On 29 July 2016, a total of 50 officers had sat down together in the auditorium to read their choice of newspapers, books or magazines.

Such a simple act not only enabled officers to set aside time to read their favourite books, but also went a long way in making books available for young children in the years to come.

The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) held its inaugural “Do Your Part to Stamp Out Corruption” Exhibition cum Roadshow at the National Library from 15 to 16 June 2013. 

The Exhibition showcased over 80 winning posters from the Poster-Slogan Competition of the same theme. The Competition had produced 6 winning works, 20 merit pieces as well as 239 individual creations. The winners had received their prizes from former Director CPIB, Mr Eric Tan. A proud moment for the winners as their family members joined them on this joyous occasion.

Attracted over 1,000 visitors, the Roadshow had featured activities such as quizzes, badge-making and circle painting allowing members of the public to learn more about corruption through fun and engaging ways. The circle painting, in particular, was an activity that required the collaborative effort of the community. The visitors to the Roadshow cum Exhibition were invited to add on their own circles using the colourful paint provided to turn the blank canvases into meaningful artwork. The simple strokes and colours contributed by people from different walks of life and across all ages reinforced the message that everyone can play a part in Singapore’s fight against corruption and the power of community efforts.

This event was especially meaningful as the graft-busters and the public came together, combined their efforts and did their part to fight corruption. The Singapore Hotel Association collaborated with the Bureau for this outreach event.

On 13 January 2015, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) and the Civil Service College (CSC) jointly organised the Integrity In Action: Public Service Values Conference 2015. Held at Suntec City, the half-day Conference saw more than 600 public officers from all levels of the Public Service.

Delivering the keynote address was Guest-of-Honour Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who stressed that Singapore must maintain its zero tolerance towards corruption. Addressing officers from different government agencies who were present at the conference, PM Lee said “One principal reason why the Public Service has been able to do good for Singapore was because you have enjoyed trust from Singaporeans. We trust the Public Service to carry out your duties capably and competently. And we trust the Public Service to act with integrity, always in the public interest”. He urged Public Servants to “safeguard” this public trust and contribute to making Singapore “a better home for all”.  

PM Lee also announced stronger measures the Bureau would be taking to tackle graft in Singapore, which includes CPIB’s new initiatives. Participants at the conference also got the opportunity to engage PM Lee and Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean in a dialogue session on the challenges faced by public officers in upholding integrity in their daily work. The Conference concluded with two presentations by colleagues from the Ministry of Finance and the Housing Development Board.

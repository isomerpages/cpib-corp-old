In 2013, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau held its inaugural Anti-Corruption Executive (ACE) Programme from 3 to 14 June. The programme was open to selected overseas and local participants for the purpose of bringing together academics and enforcement officers to share and discuss about the diverse challenges faced by anti-corruption agencies in a rapidly-changing socio-economic, political and legal environment.

In August this year, the CPIB once again hosted local and selected overseas participants for the biennial ACE Programme. Across the span of three weeks, participants had the opportunity to visit several agencies such as the CPIB, Immigrations and Checkpoints Authority of Singapore (ICA), the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and even took a trip to Kuala Lumpur to visit the Malaysia Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC). They also met local academics such as Prof Mak Yuen Teen and Prof John Quah who spoke about Corporate Governance in the Private Sector and Curbing Corruption Effectively respectively. 

As part of the programme, the foreign participants also shared about the corruption situation in their home country as well as the efforts to battle corruption. The participants also had a fireside chat with Director CPIB, where they discussed about corruption issues as well as the different aspects of the Bureauâ€™s work.

The three weeks went by quickly and the ACE Programme concluded with a Graduation Ceremony cum closing dinner, where Director CPIB presented each participant with a certificate of participation and a memento. It was a bittersweet moment for all as they bade farewell to one another. The course has forged new friendships and camaraderie among the participants.

As part of the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau’s (CPIB) ongoing anti-corruption efforts, a new Corruption Reporting & Heritage Centre (CRHC) located at 247 Whitley Road, Singapore 297830, has been operational with effect 9 January 2017. Members of public can now make corruption complaints with an onsite Duty Officer at this new centre, which is located conveniently near Stevens MRT. Appointments to lodge a corruption complaint at the CHRC can be made here.

The centre also houses the Bureau’s heritage gallery, Singapore’s first-ever interactive gallery about corruption! Those who are interested in learning more about Singapore’s anti-corruption journey and the role that CPIB plays can visit the heritage centre during the opening hours. The CRHC is open from 10am to 7pm on weekdays and 10am to 4pm on Saturdays (except public holidays).

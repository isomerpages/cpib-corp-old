Since 2011, the CPIB has been bringing cheer to underprivileged children from Beyond Social Services during the end-of-year Christmas period by organising activities and sponsoring small tokens to brighten up their holidays.

From 2011 to 2013, the Bureau had organised special movie screenings at Vivo City Golden Village for more than 40 children each year. Besides the movie, the children were also presented with goodie bags containing yummy snacks, toys and stationaries.

In 2014, the Bureau brightened up the lives of more than 40 children from Beyond Social Services. The children were treated to an afternoon outing at Hort Park, where they learnt about the various flora and fruits blooming in the gardens and also tried their hand at planting a potted plant. A sumptuous nasi lemak lunch filled their tummies. The highlight, however, had to be the goodie bag filled with cookies and sweets for them to bring back to enjoy.

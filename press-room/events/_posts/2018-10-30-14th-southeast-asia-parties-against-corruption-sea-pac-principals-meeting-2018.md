In October 2018, the CPIB assumed Chairmanship of the Southeast Asia Parties Against Corruption (SEA-PAC), which is a grouping of anti-corruption agencies from ASEAN countries established in December 2004. In this regard, the CPIB hosted the 14th Principals Meeting of the SEA-PAC held in Singapore from 30-31 October 2018. It was attended by several Heads of agencies or their deputies from these agencies. In line with Singapore’s ASEAN Chairmanship 2018, the CPIB adopted the theme – “A Resilient and Innovative ASEAN: Strengthening SEA-PAC’s capacity to combat corruption through constructive engagement and cooperation” to bring into focus the need for the region to develop the resilience and innovative mind-set to formulate effective and collaborative approaches to tackle challenges, including those relating to combatting corruption, in a timely manner.

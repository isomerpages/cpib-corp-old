The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau successfully organised the biennial third run of the Anti-Corruption Executive (ACE) Programme which was held from 23 October to 3 November 2017. The 2-week ACE Programme discussed and exchanged ideas on strategies to tackle the diverse challenges faced by anti-corruption agencies in an ever changing socio-economic, legal and geo-political environment.

This round, participants had the opportunity to attend a three-day programme at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP) to discourse on topics relating to governance, ethics and corruption from a public policy perspective. Besides visits to several other agencies, they also got to meet distinguished professors, who shared a different perspective from investigators and lent interesting insights to the value of governance, ethics and anti-corruption efforts. In addition, the programme included a session with Ex-Head of Civil Service Mr Lim Siong Guan, who also shared his experience on leadership and the secret to Singaporeâ€™s success amidst the ever changing global environment.

As part of the outdoor leadership component, two days of the programme were held in Sentosa. One activity which the participants are unlikely to forget at least for a while, was the dragon boat expedition, where they took up their paddles to row from Sentosa to Lazarus Island. It was by no means an easy feat but the exuberance and determination of the participants came up tops in the end. 

The two-week ACE programme concluded on 3 November 2017. Firm friendships were made and it was a rewarding experience for all who attended. The ACE Programme was well received by the participants and the CPIB is heartened by the encouraging feedback from them.

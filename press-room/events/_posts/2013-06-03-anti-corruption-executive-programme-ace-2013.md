In 2013, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau held its inaugural Anti-Corruption Executive (ACE) Programme from 3 to 14 June. The programme was open to selected overseas and local participants for the purpose of bringing together academics and enforcement officers to share and discuss about the diverse challenges faced by anti-corruption agencies in a rapidly-changing socio-economic, political and legal environment.

As part of the programme, the participants had the opportunity to visit several agencies such as the Woodlands Checkpoint, and even took a trip to Johor Bahru to visit one of Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commissionâ€™s (MACC) office branches.

Across the span of two weeks, the participants also met local academics and industry leaders who are experts in the field of security and corruption.  Professor Jon Quah, a renowned local Anti-Corruption Consultant delivered an insightful talk on Corruption and Governance in Asian Countries while Professor Teo Chee Khiang from the National University of Singapore (NUS) spoke about Government Auditing and Corruption.

The participants were also given practical examples of corruption in the real world through conversations with Mr Owen Hawkes, Director of Forensics in KPMG Services Pte Ltd and Mr Tommy Chong, Former Senior Regional Security Advisor of the British Petroleum (BP) who spoke about Forensic Accounting and Corruption Investigations, and Corruption in Business World respectively.

The two weeks went by in the blink of an eye as the participants reflected upon and shared with one another their thoughts and takeaways. The inaugural ACE Programme concluded on a high note as new friendships were fostered and networks established.

Individuals who resort to corrupt means to advance business interests will have to face the full consequences of the law.

2\.      On 3 June 2020, Khoo Chen Ee (“Khoo”), 邱正宇, a 36-year-old male Singaporean Permanent Resident in the employment of Hydrochem (S) Pte Ltd (“Hydrochem”), was charged with three counts of corruptly accepting and agreeing to accept  about $7,000 from a Director of Leeds HR Solution Pte Ltd (“Leeds”), one Elumalai Selvakumar, as rewards for furthering the business interest of Leeds with Hydrochem. These constituted offences punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

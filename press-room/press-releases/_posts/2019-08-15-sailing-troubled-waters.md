Individuals and companies which employ corrupt methods to acquire business deals will get into trouble with the law.

2\.       On 15 August 2019, Tan Chee Keong (陈志强), the 49-year-old Director of Hai Hup Huat Private Limited and its related entities (“Hai Hup Huat”), was charged with 40 counts of corruptly giving gratification totalling $178,150. 36 of these charges are amalgamated charges. Tan gave gratification amounting to this total sum over 310 occasions to 40 individuals (boarding officers, shipping agents and employees) to advance the business interests of Hai Hup Huat. These constitute offences punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.       Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to give bribes to another individual or entity. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

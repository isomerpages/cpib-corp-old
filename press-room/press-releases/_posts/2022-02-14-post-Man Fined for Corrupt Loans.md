On 14 February 2022, Chia Wee Cheng (“Chia”) (谢伟清, 42-year-old male Singaporean) was sentenced to pay a fine of S$4,000 for corruption offences. At the material time, Chia was a Health, Safety and Environment (“HSE”) Officer employed by Anotech Energy Singapore Pte Ltd (“Anotech”). He was seconded to Linde GMBH Branch Office Singapore (“Linde GMBH”), to provide supervision services for the New Pitch Gasification Plant project located at Jurong Island.

2\.	 As a HSE officer for Linde GMBH, Chia was responsible for conducting site inspections, reviewing site documents and handling other safety-related matters. In addition, Chia was also required to review and approve the Permit-To-Work (“PTW”) submitted by contractors for various construction work activities such as bore piling and foundation works, which is required for works to begin at the project site. 

3\.	Sometime on 11 October 2020, Chia asked a site supervisor from a subcontractor of Linde GMBH for a loan of S$300 when the latter met with him to seek his approval for a PTW. Subsequently, sometime on 31 October 2020, Chia asked the same site supervisor for a loan of S$500. The site supervisor agreed to give the loans to Chia on both occasions as he hoped that Chia would be lenient to him regarding the approval of his PTW and safety inspections on site. The site supervisor was also afraid that Chia might make things difficult  if he refused to do so. 

4\.	Sometime on 29 November 2020, Chia asked a construction manager from another subcontractor of Linde GMBH for a loan of S$1,500 to S$2,000. The construction manager agreed and gave the accused a loan of S$1,000 as he was afraid that Chia might make his work difficult if he refused to do so. 

5\.	For his actions, Chia Wee Cheng was charged in Court on 28 September 2021 for three counts of corruption, which are offences punishable under the Prevention of Corruption Act. 

6	 Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or both.

Without proper procurement processes in place, building maintenance work can easily turn into an area of concern for corruption-related offences. 

2\.        On 20 January 2020, Choo Chiow Hwee, a 70-year-old Singaporean male was sentenced to a fine of $2,500 and additional penalty of $1,200 for corruption.

3\.        At the material time of the offence, Choo was the Condominium Manager of Melana International Pte Ltd deployed at D’Manor Condominium (“D’Manor”). His job involved sourcing for, and recommending contractors for the maintenance of the condominium. Investigations by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau revealed that Choo had solicited for a loan from Shen Jun, the Director of Bonwin Pte Ltd (“Bonwin”). Shen initially declined the request but eventually relented after Choo promised Shen that he would help Bonwin to secure a D’Manor cleaning contract. Shen agreed and extended a $1,200 loan to Choo. Choo subsequently provided advice and assistance to Shen to increase Bonwin’s chances of securing the contract. These involved providing a handwritten scope of works for Shen to include in Bonwin’s quotation and giving updates of the management council’s contractor selection.

4\.        Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to give or accept bribes from another individual or entity in return for favours. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

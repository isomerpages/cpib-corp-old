On 27 August 2021, two individuals were charged in court for alleged corruption and Penal Code offences. They are:

a)    **Jamaludin Bin Mohamed (“Jamaludin”)** (58-year-old male Singapore Citizen), an Assistant Engineer of the Public Utilities Board (“PUB”) at the material time; and <br>
b)    **Ganisan s/o Suppiah (“Ganisan”)** (51-year-old male Singapore Citizen), a Project Manager of Pipe Works Pte Ltd (“Pipe Works”) at the material time.

**Corruption Offences**
	
2\.         Between 2017 and 2018, Jamaludin allegedly obtained gratification of about S$45,000 on multiple occasions from Ganisan in return for facilitating and expediting works performed by Pipe Works and supervised by Jamaludin. Sometime in July 2019, Jamaludin also allegedly attempted to obtain a bribe of S$500,000 from a company which submitted a bid for a PUB tender some time in 2019. In the same month, Jamaludin similarly attempted to obtain a bribe of an unspecified amount from another company in relation to the same PUB tender. The alleged bribe attempts by Jamaludin were purportedly in return for assisting the companies with their bids for the PUB tender. The companies rejected Jamaludin’s requests for bribes.

3\.         For his actions, Jamaludin will face one charge under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (“PCA”) read with Section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”) and two charges under Section 6(a) of the PCA. Ganisan will face one charge under Section 6(b) of the PCA read with Section 124(4) of the CPC.

**Penal Code Offences**

4\.         On or about 16 and 23 November 2017, Jamaludin allegedly prepared fake invoices under a company he had set up to receive monies from Ganisan. For his actions, Jamaludin will face two charges punishable under Section 477A of the Penal Code. For his alleged role in abetting Jamaludin in the preparation of said fake invoices, Ganisan will also face two charges punishable under Section 477A of the Penal Code.

5\.         Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption and other crimes. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both. The maximum imprisonment term for each offence of corruption can be increased to 7 years if it is in relation to a matter or contract with the Government or public body, or a subcontract to execute work comprised in such contract. Any person convicted of falsifying accounts under Section 477A of the Penal Code can be fined or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 10 years, or to both.

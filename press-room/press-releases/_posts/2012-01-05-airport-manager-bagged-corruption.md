The accused, Abdul Rahim Bin Jumaat, was employed as a Duty Terminal Manager at the Baggage Department of the Singapore Airport Terminal Services Limited (SATS). His responsibilities included overseeing the daily loading and unloading operation of passenger baggage for incoming and outgoing flights from Changi Airport Terminal 2.

2\.         Investigations revealed that between 6 November 2007 to 29 April 2008, the accused had allegedly accepted gratifications totaling $5,080/- from one Abdul Falik Bin Abdul Latiff (Falik), a freelance airport agent, in return for information of passengers with no check-in baggage. Falik had purportedly used the information to help his clients who are foreign passengers with excess baggage. These excess baggage were included under the quota meant for those passengers without any check-in baggage so that the clients did not have to pay the excess baggage charge.

3\.         The accused had made unauthorized access into the Kris Check system (used by Changi Airport) on 25 occasions from 5 November 2007 to 25 April 2008, to obtain the names and information of passengers (with no check-in baggage) for Falik.

4\.         The accused will appear in Court on 5 January 2012 for 12 counts of corruptly accepting gratifications under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Cap 241, as well as 25 counts of computer misuse under Section 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act, Cap 50A. Some of the charges are attached for reference.

5\.         The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) takes a serious view of any corrupt practices in Singapore and will not hesitate to take action against any parties involved.

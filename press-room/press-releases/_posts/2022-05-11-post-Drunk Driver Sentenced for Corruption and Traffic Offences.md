On 11 May 2022, **Krishna Rao A/L Narisama Naidoo (“Krishna”)** (34-year-old
male Malaysian), was sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment, a fine of S$5,000 and disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 30 months for offering
a bribe to a Traffic Police Officer and various traffic offences.
 
2\. Investigations revealed that on 21 November 2021, at around Pioneer Road, Senior
Staff Sergeant Muhammad Azhar (“SSSgt Azhar”) and Sergeant (2) Firhan Bin Abdul Rashid
(“Sgt Firhan”) arrived at the scene of a motorcycle accident involving Krishna. At the scene,
Krishna admitted to Sgt Firhan that he had consumed alcohol. Krishna first slipped a S$5
note to Sgt Firhan and said to him “please help”. SSSgt Azhar and Sgt Firhan continued to
interview the accused and a breathalyzer test was conducted on Krishna, which Krishna
subsequently failed. As Krishna had failed the breathalyzer test, Sgt Firhan conducted a
personal search on Krishna and placed Krishna under arrest. In the course of the personal
search, Krishna retrieved a S$50 note from his bag and offered the money to Sgt Firhan, as
an inducement to omit investigating him for traffic offences. No bribe offers were accepted
by Sgt Firhan and the case was reported to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau
(CPIB). For his actions, Krishna was initially charged in Court on 16 February 2022 for
corruption under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.


3\. In addition to the corruption offences, Krishna was also convicted and sentenced for
drink driving under Section 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act and careless driving as a serious
offender under Section 65(1)(a) of the Road Traffic Act.


4\. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person
who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to
imprisonment of up to five years or both.

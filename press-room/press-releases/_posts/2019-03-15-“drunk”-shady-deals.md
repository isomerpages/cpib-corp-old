Resorting to bribery to further business interests is unfair and illegal. Individuals should never conspire to conduct business dealings through corrupt means. 

2\.          On 15 March 2019, two individuals were charged with the following: 

**a) Lawrence Ee Yeow Khiang (余耀强), 45-year-old male Singaporean, a Director of Wine World Pte Ltd at the material time.** 

i . Three counts of abetment by engaging in a conspiracy with one Arron Soh Hua Foo, a director at Wine World Pte Ltd (“Wine World”) to corruptly give gratification totaling $9,260 to one Yeo Kim Long, an operations manager at Ethanol Pte Ltd (“Ethanol”) as a reward for advancing the business interest of Wine World with Ethanol between June to September 2016. These constitute offences punishable under section 6(b) read with section 29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

**b) Sean Tan (陈子祥), 27-year-old male Singaporean, Managing Director of Primo Holdings Pte Ltd at the material time.** 

ii. Three counts of abetment by engaging in a conspiracy with one Arron Soh Hua Foo, a free-lance business development manager at Primo Holdings Pte Ltd (“Primo”) (who is also a director at Wine World) to corruptly give gratification totaling $2,990 to one Yeo Kim Long, an operations manager at Ethanol as a reward for advancing the business interest of Primo with Ethanol between April to June 2016. These constitute offences punishable under section 6(b) read with section 29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.         Both Yeo Kim Long and Arron Soh Hua Foo were earlier convicted. Yeo Kim Long was sentenced to 4 months and 10 weeks’ imprisonment and ordered to pay a penalty of $15,154 for corruption and Penal Code offences. Arron Soh Hua Foo was sentenced to 6 weeks and 10 days’ imprisonment for corruption offences. 

4\.         Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to give, or attempt to give bribes to another individual or entity in return for favours. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

On 18 November 2022, five individuals will be charged in Court for allegedly committing corruption offences. They are:

a) **Calvin Ang Wei Sheng (“Calvin”)** (洪伟胜, 39-year-old male Singaporean), a Workshop Supervisor of New Hope Food Industries Pte Ltd at the material time;

b) **Ismail Bin Musun Mollah (“Ismail”)** (56-year-old male Singaporean);

c) **Irees Bin Rahman (“Irees”)** (49-year-old male Singaporean);

d) **Sidek Bin Jamaludin (“Sidek”)** (42-year-old male Singaporean); and

e) **Muhammad Shaifullah Bin Ab Latif (“Shaifullah”)** (36-year-old male Singaporean).

2\. Sometime between September and October 2021, Calvin was alleged to have corruptly received gratifications totalling S$1,200 over five occasions from Ismail, Irees, Sidek, and Shaifullah. These gratifications were rewards to purchase and smuggle Epam pills into Changi Prison for the four said individuals. Epam pills contain nitrazepam, which is a medicine with sedative effects used in the treatment of conditions including insomnia (trouble or difficulty in sleeping) or sleeping disorders.

3\. For his actions, Calvin faces five charges for offences punishable under Section 5(a)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Correspondingly, Ismail faces two charges, and Irees, Sidek and Shaifullah each faces one charge for offences punishable under Section 5(b)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

4\. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence under Section 5 of the Prevention of Corruption Act can be fined up to S$100,000, sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years, or both.

5\. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) looks into all corruption-related

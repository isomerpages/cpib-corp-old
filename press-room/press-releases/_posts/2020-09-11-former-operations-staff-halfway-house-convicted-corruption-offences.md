Individuals working in rehabilitation services play an important role in reintegrating inmates back into society and should maintain a high standard of integrity for both themselves and those under their charge. Those who seek corrupt gratification from residents in these institutions in exchange for being lenient in supervising them will face serious consequences.

2\.        On 11 September 2020, **Roy Evan S/O Rajoo (“Roy Evan”)**, a 60-year-old Singaporean male, was sentenced to 11 weeks’ imprisonment and a penalty of $980.

3\.        Roy Evan was a former Operations Staff of Teen Challenge (Singapore) (“TCS”), a halfway house that provides rehabilitation for inmates from the Singapore Prison Service emplaced on community-based programmes. His duty was to check on the residents and ensure that they do not contravene the TCS’ rules prohibiting the consumption and possession of cigarettes and alcohol during their stay in TCS. This included conducting smokerlyser and breathalyser tests upon their return to TCS after work or visiting. He was to put up an Incident Report if there had been any violations. 

4\.        Investigations by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) revealed that between November 2018 to May 2019, Roy Evan had corruptly obtained gratification from 12 residents of TCS in the form of loans amounting to about $3,000. In return, he would show leniency by not conducting the required tests on these residents or not putting up Incident Reports when they were caught violating the rules. Apart from the 12 residents, Roy Evan also attempted to obtain loans from two other residents but was unsuccessful. These actions constituted offences punishable under the Prevention of Corruption Act and he was charged accordingly on 3 June 2020.

5\.        Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to solicit bribes from individuals. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

6\.         The CPIB looks into all corruption complaints and reports, including anonymous ones, and can be reached via the following channels:

a) Call the Duty Officer at 1800-376-0000;<br />
b) Lodge an [e-Complaint](/e-services/e-complaint-for-corrupt-conduct);<br>

d) Write to us at the CPIB Headquarters @ 2 Lengkok Bahru, S159047.

7\.        Where possible, the report should include the following information:

a) Where, when and how the alleged corrupt act happened?<br />
b) Who was involved and what were their roles?<br />
c) What was the bribe given and the favour shown?

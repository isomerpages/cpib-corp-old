Law enforcement officers are expected to maintain the highest standards of integrity and uphold justice. Those who pervert the course of justice must bear the full weight of the law.

2\.      On 8 June 2021, Quak Tiong Beng (“Quak”), 郭忠明, a Staff Sergeant with the Singapore Police Force (“SPF”) was sentenced to five months’ imprisonment for intentionally aiding Casper Ang (“Casper”), 洪伟良, to pervert the course of justice.

3\.      Investigations revealed that Quak was deployed as a Person-In-Custody (“PIC”) officer and was responsible for managing lock-up facilities at Police Cantonment Complex (“PCC”), which included the physical security of the lock-up. On 23 April 2019, Quak had assisted Casper to call a witness in Casper’s case and relay the instructions to the witness should he be interviewed by the Police and asked to identify someone from a photograph. Casper’s instruction was for the witness to falsely inform the police that he had seen the person in the photograph before, but could not confirm who the person was. This was to get the witness to support Casper’s story to the police and to ultimately hamper the investigations against Casper. At the material time, Casper was in remand at the PCC lock-up for investigations.

4\.      Quak was charged in court on 21 January 2020 with one count of intentionally aiding Casper to pervert the course of justice as a public servant whose duty it was to prevent the commission of the offence under Section 204A, read with Section 116 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

5\.       Singapore takes a serious view against corruption and any criminal activities. Any person who is convicted of an offence of intentionally perverting the course of justice under Section 204A of the Penal Code can be fined or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 7 years or to both. A person in Quak’s position who intentionally aids someone else to pervert the course of justice under Section 204A read with Section 116 of the Penal ode may be fined or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 3.5 years or with both.

Individuals who engage in corrupt practices will face serious consequences and the full brunt of the law.

2\.        On 28 February 2020, a 45-year-old Singaporean male, Yussri Bin AB Hamid (“Yussri”), was sentenced to a fine of $6,000 and a penalty of $600 for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.        The offences were committed when Yussri was employed as a Condominium Manager in several companies at different junctures, including SteadLink Asset Management Pte Ltd (“SteadLink”), Knight Frank Property Assets Management (“Knight Frank”), and finally Crimson Estate Management Pte Ltd (“Crimson”).

4\.         Investigations revealed that in May 2018, whilst employed at SteadLink, Yussri corruptly obtained gratification of $600 from Heng Boo Chye (“Heng”), the Director of Fukai Environmental Pte Ltd (“Fukai”), as a reward for awarding a water feature job at North Oaks Condominium to Fukai. He initially called Heng to request for a 10% commission of the value of the job that was awarded, but was eventually paid a sum of $600 as Heng had not received full payment. Additionally, on five other occasions sometime between early-2017 and mid-2018, Yussri had corruptly solicited gratifications from Ng Hwee Theng, the Sales General Manager of HLH Singapore Pte Ltd (“HLH”), and Tan Hui Shan Karen, the Project Manager of The Playground Affair Pte Ltd (“The Playground Affair”). These gratifications were inducements for recommending and awarding various building, upgrading and replacement works for North Oaks Condominium, Rivergate Condominium and Citylife @ Tampines Condominium to the two companies.

5\.         Yussri was charged in Court on 6 February with one count of corruptly obtaining gratification of $600 from the Director of Fukai, and five counts of corruptly soliciting gratifications from the Sales General Manager of HLH and the Project Manager of The Playground Affair. These constituted offences punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

6\.         Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

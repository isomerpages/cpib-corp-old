Singapore retained its high score of 85 for the Transparency International (TI) Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) for 2021. Out of 180 countries, Singapore is ranked 4th least corrupt nation in the world, tied with Sweden and Norway. Likewise, there is a tie for the top 3 countries – Denmark, Finland and New Zealand. Singapore remains the only Asian country ranked in the top 10 in the last ten years.

2\.	The TI-CPI ranks and measures countries by their perceived levels of public sector corruption. The 2021 index draws upon 13 expert assessments and surveys of business-people and country experts. Countries are then scored on a scale of zero, for highly corrupt, to 100, for very clean.

3\.	In this year’s report, TI cautioned that as countries rolled out some of the world’s biggest economic recovery plans to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, such large-scale responses when conducted without adequate checks and balances, would inevitably lead to corruption. 

4\.	 In Singapore, the corruption situation continues to remain firmly under control despite the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. The latest annual corruption statistics released by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) in 2021 indicates that the number of corruption cases has remained low. Singapore is well-regarded internationally for its firm commitment to upholding the rule of law with zero tolerance for corruption. Singapore continues to perform well across international indices for incorruptibility and clean public sector. Apart from the good results achieved in the TI-CPI, the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) ranked Singapore as the least corrupt country in its 2021 Report on Corruption in Asia, a position we have held since 1995. In the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index 2021, Singapore was ranked 3rd for absence of corruption, the top Asian nation out of 139 countries ranked.

5\.	“Singapore’s performance on the Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index and other international indices is the result of the strong political will to fight corruption, as well as the constant vigilance and unwavering determination by the Public Service and the Public to keep corruption at bay. There is no room for complacency as the corruption threat is always evolving. As we mark the 70th anniversary of CPIB this year, CPIB and its officers remain steadfast and resolute in working with Singaporeans and the community to fight corruption wherever it exists and in whatever form it takes,” said Mr Denis Tang, Director CPIB.

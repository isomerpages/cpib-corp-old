Singapore’s Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) joins law enforcement agencies from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA) in launching a new International Anti-Corruption Coordination Centre (IACCC) on 5 July 2017. The multinational centre is intended to coordinate law enforcement action against global grand corruption.

2\.         Hosted by the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA), the London-based IACCC is envisaged to improve information sharing by bringing together specialist law enforcement officers from multiple jurisdictions into a single location. The UK NCA will host the IACCC until 2021. For further reference, the joint IACCC Press Release by the UK NCA can be accessed at http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/1138-international-partners-join-forces-to-tackle-global-grand-corruption.

3\.         Grand corruption includes acts of corruption by politically exposed persons that may involve vast quantities of assets, and those that threaten political stability and sustainable development. These can comprise bribery of public officials, embezzlement, abuse of functions or the laundering of the proceeds of crime. Such acts increase poverty and inequality, undermine good business and threaten the integrity of financial markets.

4\.         Recognising the importance of addressing corruption at all levels as well as across borders, Singapore had agreed with the intent to establish the IACCC and has worked with other interested parties on its establishment. As part of its commitment as a founding member of the IACCC, CPIB will be contributing an officer to serve at the IACCC.

5\.         Singapore has in place a framework for international cooperation with overseas law enforcement and regulatory agencies. The CPIB has good relations with and continues to work closely with our foreign counterparts in the investigation of corruption offences through operational channels and mutual legal assistance arrangements. Participation in the IACCC will provide further opportunity for CPIB to work with its counterparts against grand corruption.

6\.         Mr Wong Hong Kuan, Director, CPIB said, “Corruption has become increasingly transnational in nature and can severely affect national interests. The IACCC provides a platform for enhancing international coordination against grand corruption. CPIB is supportive of the IACCC initiative and stands together with our international partners in the global fight against corruption”.

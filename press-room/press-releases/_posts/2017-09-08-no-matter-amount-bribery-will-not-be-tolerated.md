On 7 September 2017, one Palaniappan Ramanathan, an Indian national, was sentenced to four weeks' imprisonment for his attempt to bribe an Auxiliary Police Officer.

2\.        Palaniappan had been charged in court on 27 July 2017 with one count of corruptly offering gratification to one Hairul Azrin Bin Anual, an Auxiliary Police Officer employed by Certis Cisco Security Pte Ltd and attached to Jurong East Neighbourhood Police Centre, as an inducement to refrain from taking enforcement action against him, an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.        Investigations revealed that on 14 April 2017, Officer Hairul while on patrolling duties, had spotted Palaniappan urinating against a MRT track pillar at Jurong East MRT Station. Officer Hairul and a team mate then approached Palaniappan to inform him that it is an offence to urinate in a public place. He then asked Palaniappan to produce his work permit. Instead of producing his work permit, Palaniappan took out a $10 note from his right pocket, offered it to Officer Hairul and asked him to let him off. The bribe was rejected by Officer Hairul who warned Palaniappan bribery is an offence in Singapore. The matter was reported to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau.

4\.        In Singapore, it is an offence to bribe, or attempt to offer a bribe. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both.

5\.        Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

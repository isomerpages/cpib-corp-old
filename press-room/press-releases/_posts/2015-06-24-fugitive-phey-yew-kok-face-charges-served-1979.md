Phey Yew Kok, who absconded on 7 January 1980, has been produced in Court on 24 June 2015 to face the charges that were served on him in 1979.

2\.        Phey was charged in Court on 10 December 1979 for four counts of Criminal Breach of Trust (CBT) and other offences under the Trade Unions Act (Cap 129). He was released on bail. On 7 January 1980, Phey failed to turn up in Court and a Warrant of Arrest was subsequently issued against him on the same day.

3\.        Phey surrendered himself at the Singapore Embassy in Bangkok on 22 June 2015. On 23 June 2015, CPIB officers accompanied Phey back to Singapore. Phey will be required to assist CPIB in further investigations in relation to other offences he may have committed.

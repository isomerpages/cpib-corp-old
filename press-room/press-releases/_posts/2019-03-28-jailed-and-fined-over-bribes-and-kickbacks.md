Companies should report any solicitation for bribes to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). Agents who solicit bribes will be dealt with by the law.

2\.          On 28 March 2019, Jamaluddin Bin Hassan (“Jamaluddin”), a 59-year-old former Purchaser at Yamato Technologies Pte Ltd (“Yamato”), was sentenced to three weeks' imprisonment and a fine of $6,000 for corruption. He was also ordered to pay a penalty of $1,300.

3\.          At the material time of offences, Jamaluddin was in charge of liaising with suppliers to get quotations. He would then evaluate these quotations before recommending the award of contracts to suppliers. Investigations by the CPIB revealed that Jamaluddin had corruptly obtained, or attempted to obtain, bribes from suppliers.

4\.           In 2016, in the midst of price negotiations for a sales contract, Jamaluddin had asked a Sales Engineer working at Delta-Flo Controls Pte Ltd (“Delta-Flo”) for a loan of $2,000. He told the latter that he would, in return, help promote Delta-Flo’s products to Yamato and recommend Delta-Flo for the contract. Jamaluddin’s request was rejected and Delta-Flo was ultimately not awarded the contract by Yamato.

5\.          In 2017, Jamaluddin started liaising with a Sales and Marketing Executive at Senator International Singapore Pte Ltd (“Senator”) regarding a contract to ship items from Germany to the Philippines. Senator was eventually awarded the shipment job by Yamato. Sometime in August 2017, Jamaluddin requested for kickbacks amounting to $1,000 from the executive. The executive conveyed the request to his Managing Director, who acceded to Jamaluddin’s request as he was afraid that Jamaluddin would create problems for Senator in relation to the shipment job. The Managing Director passed the executive a $1,000 note, which was subsequently given to Jamaluddin.

6\.           Jamaluddin proceeded to approach the same executive to request for loans on another two separate occasions. Although Jamaluddin’s first request for a $300 loan was acceded to, his second request for a $100 loan was rejected as the Senator employees felt that Jamaluddin was someone who could not be satisfied.

7\.          For his actions, Jamaluddin was charged on 8 March 2019 with four counts of corruptly obtaining or corruptly attempting to obtain gratifications amounting to $2,000 and $1,400 from the Sales Engineer of Delta-Flo and the Sales and Marketing Executive of Senator respectively. These constituted offences punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Chapter 241).

8\.          Singapore does not tolerate corruption. It is a serious offence to obtain bribes, or attempt to obtain bribes and any person who is convicted of corruption can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

The abuse of oneâ€™s privileged position in a government organisation to favour a particular individual or company for personal gain can result in dire consequences.

2\.        On 3 December 2015, Gursharan Kaur Sharon Rachael, a 55-year-old female Singaporean who was a former lead contract specialist of the United States Navy (U.S. Navy), will be charged in Court for the following corruption and money-laundering offences:

i. Seven counts of corruptly obtaining gratification worth a total sum of S$130,278.24 in the form of cash and paid accommodation in luxury hotels from one Leonard Glenn Francis, the Chief Executive Officer of Glenn Defense Marine (Asia) Pte Ltd, as a reward for providing him with non-public U.S. Navy information, an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.        The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) had worked closely with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), U.S. Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) and the United States Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) to conduct a joint investigation that resulted in the prosecution of Gursharan Kaur Sharon Rachael.

4\.        Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The CPIB takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and the laundering of benefits from criminal conduct, and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts. Singapore has in place a framework for international cooperation with overseas legal, law enforcement and regulatory agencies. The CPIB will continue to work closely with foreign law enforcement agencies in the investigation of corruption offences.

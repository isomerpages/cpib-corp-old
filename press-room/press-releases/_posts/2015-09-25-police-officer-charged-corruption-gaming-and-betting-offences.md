Staff Sergeant (SSGT) Woo Poh Liang, a Police Officer, will be charged in Court on 25 September 2015 for two counts of allegedly corruptly obtaining gratification amounting to $35,000 as an inducement to help one Beltran Angelo Salvador avoid prosecution. This is an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. He will also be charged for offences under the Common Gaming House Act, Chapter 49 and under the Betting Act, Chapter 21.

2\.        SSGT Woo joined the Singapore Police Force (SPF) in June 2008, and has been interdicted from service since 29 January 2015.

3\.        Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption, and law enforcement officers are expected to uphold high standards of discipline and integrity. The authorities will not hesitate to take action against errant officers. Those who commit offences can expect to be charged in Court and dealt with in accordance with the law.

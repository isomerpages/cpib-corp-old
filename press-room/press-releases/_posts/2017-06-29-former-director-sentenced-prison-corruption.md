On 29 June 2017, one Alex Ong Boon Chuan, former Director at Resorts World at Sentosa Pte Ltd, was sentenced to 22 weeks’ imprisonment and ordered to pay a penalty of $39,000 for corruption.  

2\.          Investigations revealed that from July 2010 to May 2011, Ong had on five occasions, asked for loans amounting to $39,000 from one Ng Soon Yong, Director of Mecflou Pte Ltd.  At that time, Mecflou Pte Ltd was a sub-contractor for the mechanical installation of one of the rides at Universal Studios Singapore. As Ng did not want to offend Ong, whose job scope included approving progress payments for the project, Ng acceded to Ong’s loan requests.

3\.         Alex Ong Boon Chuan was first charged in Court on 26 February 2016 with five counts of corruptly obtaining gratification of $39,000 from Ng as an inducement to not delay progress payments to Mecflou Pte Ltd, an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

4\.          Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

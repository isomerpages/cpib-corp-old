The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) had received information on 11 April 2017 that Belousova Natalia had offered gratification of an unspecified amount to the police officers while being arrested for suspected vice activity at Swissotel Stamford. Investigations revealed that Belousova Natalia had offered “money and gifts” to all three police officers in exchange for her release from police custody.

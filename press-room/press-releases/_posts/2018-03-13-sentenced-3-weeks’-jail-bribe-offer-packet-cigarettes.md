On 13 March 2018, one Lam Kim Heng (“Lam”), a 68-year-old Singaporean, was sentenced to 3 weeks’ imprisonment for his attempt to bribe an Inspection Officer of CPG Facilities Management Pte Ltd.

2\.        Lam, the business operator of Heng Heng Eating House, had been charged in court on 22 February 2018 with corruptly offering a packet of cigarettes worth S$12.10/- to Mohd Dzulkarnain Hussein (“Dzulkarnain”), an Inspection Officer in the employ of CPG Facilities Management Pte Ltd. This was to induce Dzulkarnain to inform him in advance of future inspections at Heng Heng Eating House, an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Chapter 241).

3\.        Investigations had revealed that on 14 October 2017, Dzulkarnain was conducting an inspection at Heng Heng Eating House to check for violations of HDB regulations. CPG was HDB’s appointed agent and the consequence of breaching any of the rules during inspection could lead to issuance of summons. In the midst of the inspection, Lam had approached Dzulkarnain at the rear of Heng Heng Eating House and extended his arm with a packet of cigarettes in his hand, and told Dzulkarnain to inform him in advance of future inspections. Dzulkarnain rejected the offer of cigarettes and the matter was subsequently reported to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).

4\.        In Singapore, it is an offence to bribe, or attempt to offer a bribe. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both.

5\.        Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The CPIB takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

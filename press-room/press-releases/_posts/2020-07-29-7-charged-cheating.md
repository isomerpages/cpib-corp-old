On 29 July 2020, seven individuals were charged in Court for allegedly cheating Kurihara Kogyo Co., Ltd (“Kurihara”) in two separate schemes.

2\.        In one scheme that happened sometime in September 2017, two of the individuals allegedly engaged in a conspiracy to cheat Kurihara by informing its General Manager that its main contractor had nominated OSES Partners Pte. Ltd. (“OSES”) for Kurihara’s subcontract for electrical works, when the main contractor did not do so. By such manner of deception, the two individuals dishonestly induced General Manager of Kurihara to approve and award the said subcontract, valued at $5,673,000, to OSES. Accordingly, these two individuals were each charged with one count under Section 420 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224):

a) Ng Boon Huat (黄文发), 55-year-old Singaporean male, a Director of OSES.

b) Ng Boon Hwa (黄文华), 59-year-old Singaporean male, an assistant general manager of Kurihara.

3\.        In another scheme that happened between 2016 and 2019, five individuals (associated with Kurihara, HSH International Pte Ltd and O.A.S. Electrical Contractors) allegedly engaged in a conspiracy to cheat Kurihara by dishonestly concealing the facts that one Soh Hock Chuan Edward (“Edward”, a Senior Manager of Kurihara) and one Shen Jun (a Director of HSH International Pte. Ltd.) had interests in HSH International Pte. Ltd. (“HSH”), and that various Kurihara purchase orders for electrical maintenance works awarded to O.A.S. Electrical Contractors (“OAS”) were actually subcontracted to HSH. By such manner of deception, they dishonestly induced General Manager of Kurihara to approve and award the said purchase orders valued at a total of about $709,200 to OAS. Accordingly, these five individuals were each charged with 39 counts under Section 420 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code and one count under Section 417 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code:

a) Ang Lian Seng, 74-year-old Singaporean male, a Project Manager of OAS.

b) Chan Kit Hoe (陈颉好), 62-year-old Singaporean female, the Sole Proprietor of OAS.

c) Rayappan Antony Sagayaraj, 43-year-old Singapore Permanent Resident male, a Deputy Manager of Kurihara.

d) Soh Hock Chuan Edward (苏福泉), 56-year-old Singaporean male, a Senior Manager of Kurihara.

e) Shen Jun (沈军), 53-year-old Singaporean male, Director of HSH.

4\.        The CPIB takes a serious view against corruption and other criminal activities such as cheating. Any person who is convicted of cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property under Section 420 of the Penal Code can be sentenced to imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and also be liable to fine.

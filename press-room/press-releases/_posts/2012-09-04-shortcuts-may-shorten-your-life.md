People take shortcuts so that they can complete deadlines and accomplish objectives in a faster or easier way. Shortcut is sometimes deemed as the more efficient way. However, shortcuts are never rewarding and they may endanger lives. Imagine taking shortcuts with workplace safety regulations and requirements. Accidents may happen, lives can be lost. Read on to find out how two individuals’ corrupted actions might have risked accidents and even lives when they attempted to take “shortcuts” in the arena of workplace safety…

2\.         On 4 September 2012, two Singaporean males David Rowell Foo (David) and Chan Kwai Kwok (Chan) will be charged in court for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act. Both had attempted to bribe an assessor - Mohammad Sadli Bin Ghorsnain (Sadli) to refrain from enforcing workplace safety regulations for a Radiation Delay Tank System project.

3\.         David is the Head of Projects in Success Construction Pte Ltd (Success Construction). His job is to ensure that appropriate work processes and safety measures were observed at the work site. Chan is the sole-proprietor of Program Engineering Pte Ltd (Program Engineering) which provides engineering services.

4\.         CPIB investigations revealed that in 2009, Program Engineering was engaged by Ganendra Ariyathavaratnam (Ganerdra) for the Radiation Delay Tank System project. Program Engineering then struck a partnership with Success Construction for the project. 

5\.         As the building of the Radiation Delay Tank System will take place in confined space, strict safety requirements have to be adhered to.

6\.         Sometime in September 2009, Sadli had disallowed Success Construction to commerce work as some of their workers were not qualified to carry out the work in a confined space. David then offered an unspecified sum of money to Sadli hoping that he would be lenient. Sadli rejected the offer. Undeterred, David then proposed to Chan to request money from Ganendra to pay Sadli which Chan agreed. David then made the request to Ganendra but he did not accede to it.

7\.         David Rowell Foo will be charged for one count of corruptly offering gratification under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241; and one count of corruptly soliciting gratification in conjunction with Chan Kwai Kwok, which is an offence under section 5(a)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

8\.         Chan Kwai Kwok will be charged for one count of corruptly soliciting gratification in conjunction with David Rowell Foo, which is an offence under section 5(a)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

9\.         The respective charges are attached for reference.

10\.       Singapore has always adopted a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) takes a serious view of any corrupt practices in Singapore and will not hesitate to take action against any parties involved in corrupt practices.

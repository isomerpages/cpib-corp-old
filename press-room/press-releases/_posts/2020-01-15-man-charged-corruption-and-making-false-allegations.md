The criminal justice system in Singapore is in place to protect the sanctity of the laws and its citizens. Individuals who are shown to have engaged in corrupt acts or made false allegations will have to bear the full brunt of the law.

2\.            On 15 January 2020, Zhao Yankai, 赵彦凯, a 29-year-old Chinese national, was charged with one count of corruption under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241, and two counts of knowingly giving false information under Section 28 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.            Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption and other criminal activities. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both. Any person who is convicted of an offence of knowingly giving false information under Section 28 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241, can be fined up to $10,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 1 year or to both.

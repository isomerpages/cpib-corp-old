On 22 January 2016, former fugitive Phey Yew Kok was convicted and sentenced by the State Court to 60 months’ imprisonment. Phey faced a total of 34 charges. He pleaded guilty to 12 charges, with the remaining charges taken into consideration for purpose of sentencing. The 12 proceeded charges are as follows :

a. Eight counts of CBT as a servant, amounting to S$152,987.25, which are offences punishable under Section 408 of the Penal Code, Chapter 103, 1970 Revised Edition;
 
b. One count of CBT with common intention, amounting to S$81,686.72, which is an offence punishable under Section 408 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 103, 1970 Revised Edition;
 
c. One count of CBT, amounting to S$9,203.63, which is an offence punishable under Section 406 of the Penal Code, Chapter 103, 1970 Revised Edition;

e. One count of intentionally omitting to attend before a court of justice in obedience to an order, which is an offence punishable under Section 174 of the Penal Code, Chapter 103, 1970 Revised Edition.

2\.        Phey was first charged in Court on 10 December 1979. Subsequently, he fled jurisdiction and failed to attend his further Court mention on 7 January 1980. Phey spent the following 35 years on the run. He eventually surrendered himself at the Singapore Embassy in Bangkok on 22 June 2015, and was brought back to Singapore to face his charges.

3\.          Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption and criminal activities. There is no statute of limitations for corruption charges and the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) will not hesitate to take action against any individuals and parties involved, even if the offence was committed a long time ago.

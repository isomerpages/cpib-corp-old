Motorists are expected to abide by traffic regulations, and should be prepared to bear the consequences for any breach. Resorting to bribery does not offer any respite, and would in fact get one into more serious trouble.
 
2\.          On 9 April 2019, Chia Chan Kong (谢振光), a 66-year-old Singaporean male, was sentenced to four weeks' imprisonment for corruption. Chia was earlier charged in Court on 22 March 2019 for corruptly offering $100 to Sergeant Sheikh Abdul Muzzammil Bin Sheikh Abdul Feisal (“Sgt Sheikh”), a Traffic Police (TP) Officer. This was to induce the TP Officer to refrain from registering a report against Chia for making an illegal right turn. This constituted an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.
 
3\.          Investigations by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) revealed that on 8 October 2018, Sgt Sheikh had spotted Chia making an illegal right turn and directed Chia to stop his vehicle by the road after he had completed the turn. In a mixture of Malay and English, Chia repeatedly asked Sgt Sheikh for a chance to “settle” the issue privately. Chia proceeded to take out two pieces of $50 from his wallet and offered them to Sgt Sheikh. The bribe was immediately rejected by Sgt Sheikh and the matter was reported to the CPIB.

4\.          The CPIB would like to commend Sergeant Sheikh Abdul Muzzammil Bin Sheikh Abdul Feisal for his act of integrity which exemplifies one of the core values of the Public Service.  Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to bribe or attempt to bribe public officers. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

According to Transparency International (TI) Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) for 2017, Singapore has attained 6th position among 180 countries with a score of 84.

2\.         The CPI ranks and measures countries by their perceived levels of public sector corruption. The 2017 index is constructed based on 13 surveys covering expert assessments and views of business people. Countries are then scored on a scale of zero, for highly corrupt, to 100, for very clean. According to the data released by TI, Singapore’s rank has improved by one position while the score remained the same at 84 points in 2017.

3\.          The corruption situation in Singapore remains under control and we continue to see a low incidence of corruption. The number of corruption complaints received and cases registered for investigation hit new lows in 2016. Singapore was also ranked as the least corrupt country in the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC)’s 2017 Report on Corruption in Asia, a position it has held since 1995. In the 2017-2018 Rule of Law Index compiled by the World Justice Project (WJP), Singapore is ranked 4th for absence of corruption, the top Asian nation out of 113 countries.

4\.          “Singapore is recognised worldwide for its efficient and clean Public Service. The incidence of public sector corruption in Singapore is one of the lowest in the world. With the strong mandate from the government, the CPIB will continue to fight corruption resolutely and safeguard the integrity of the Singapore public service.” said Mr Wong Hong Kuan, Director of the CPIB.

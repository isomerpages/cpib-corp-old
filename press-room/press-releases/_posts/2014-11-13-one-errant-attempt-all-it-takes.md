Law enforcement officers are vested with the authority to clamp down on illicit activities in Singapore. Any law enforcement officer who even attempts to abuse this authority for personal and corrupt gains will face severe consequences.

2\.        On 13 November 2014, one Jonathan Sasayiah (“Sasayiah”), a 28 year-old Singaporean, who was a former investigation officer with the Singapore Customs, will be charged in Court under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241 for corruptly attempting to obtain gratification in the form of intimate acts, in return for showing leniency for an offence of possessing contraband cigarettes.

3\.        The respective charge is attached (Annex A).

4\.        Singapore has always adopted a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) takes a serious view of any corrupt practices, and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

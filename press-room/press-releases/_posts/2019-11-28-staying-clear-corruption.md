Individuals are reminded to stay clear of corruption and not use it as a means to cover up prohibited activities. 

2\.          On 28 November 2019, Li Yilin (李依霖), a 35-year old female, was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment for corruption. 

3\.          Investigations by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) revealed that Li had rented an apartment at Pacific Mansion and had subsequently sublet the unit to a group of tourists for five days and four nights via Airbnb. When these tourists arrived at Pacific Mansion, they approached security officer Mohamed Bin Sapah (“Sapah”), who was in the guardhouse and asked for keys to the apartment. Sapah then contacted Li and advised her that she was prohibited from subletting her unit for short-term occupancy. When Li arrived at Pacific Mansion, she brought the tourists to the unit and made her way to the guardhouse. There, she slipped two $50 notes under a black file to Sapah and Mohammad Sa’at Bin Abu Bakar, another security officer, so that they would not report her to the management of Pacific Mansion. The bribes were rejected by both security officers and the matter was reported to the CPIB. 

4\.          For her actions, Li was charged on 19 July 2019 with two offences of corruptly giving gratification amounting to $100 to the two security officers employed by Rightmen Security Services Pte Ltd as an inducement for them to refrain from informing the management of Pacific Mansion of Li’s actions, an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. She was convicted of one of the charges today, with the other charge taken into consideration for sentencing.

5\.          The CPIB would like to commend Mohamed Bin Sapah and Mohammad Sa’at Bin Abu Bakar for their integrity in rejecting the bribe offer. 

6\.         It is a serious offence to bribe, or attempt to bribe another individual or entity. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both.

On 26 January 2021, two individuals will be charged in Court for conspiring to cheat and dishonestly induce People’s Association (“PA”) and the Infocomm Media Development Authority (“IMDA”) into making payments totalling more than S$77,500 to various companies. The two individuals are:

a) **Ho Kiat Jeffrey (“Ho”)**, 何傑, 54-year-old male Singaporean, Principal Consultant of IMDA at the material time.

b) **Ng Sok Luan (“Ng”)**, 黄素銮, 42-year-old female Singaporean, Director of Goldentree Innovations Pte Ltd ("Goldentree") and Creative Futures Agency Pte Ltd ("Creative Futures") at the material time.

2\.         Sometime in 2018, they allegedly conspired to cheat PA by dishonestly concealing Ho’s interest in Goldentree, which is also the sub-vendor of Jzsfotografix and Zelkova Serrata (S) Private Limited (“Zelkova”). In doing so, they dishonestly induced PA into making payments, totalling almost S$35,700, to Goldentree, Jzsfotografix and Zelkova in 2018 for jobs awarded to these companies. For these actions, they each face five charges for the offence of cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property punishable under Section 420 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

3\.         In the same year, the duo also allegedly conspired to cheat IMDA by dishonestly concealing that Ho had interest in Goldentree and Creative Futures. In doing so, they dishonestly induced IMDA into making payments, totalling more than S$41,800, to Zelkova and Creative Futures in 2018 and 2019 for jobs awarded to these companies. For these actions, they each face another seven charges for the offence of cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property punishable under Section 420 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

4\.         Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption and other criminal activities such as cheating. Any person convicted of cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property under Section 420 of the Penal Code can be sentenced to imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and also be liable to a fine.

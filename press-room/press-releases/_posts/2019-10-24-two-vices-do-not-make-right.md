Bribing or attempting to bribe public officers to get out of trouble with the law is a serious offence in Singapore.

2\.          On 24 October 2019, Nguyen Loan Anh (“Nguyen”), a 49-year-old Vietnamese female on a 30-day social visit pass who was investigated in relation to vice activities, was charged with:

* One count of corruptly offering an unspecified amount of money to Sergeant Siti Nurshalina Binte Rosly (“Sgt Siti”), a police officer attached to the Criminal Investigation Department, Singapore Police Force. This constitutes an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. The gratification was offered as an inducement to release Nguyen from police custody for suspected vice activity at Hoover Hotel on 13 October 2019.

3\.          The bribe offer was immediately rejected by Sgt Siti and the matter was reported to the CPIB. The CPIB would like to commend Sgt Siti Nurshalina Binte Rosly for her act of integrity which exemplifies one of the core values of the Public Service. Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person who is convicted of corruption can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

On 1 November 2021, two former prison officers and one inmate will be charged in Court for alleged respective offences under the Official Secrets Act, Penal Code and
Computer Misuse Act. They are:

a) Muhammad Zul Helmy Bin Abdul Latip (“Helmy”) (33-year-old male Singapore
Citizen), a Singapore Prison Service (“SPS”) officer at the material time;

b) Muhammad Fattahullah Bin Mohd Nordin (“Fattahullah”) (37-year-old male
Singapore Citizen), a SPS officer at the material time; and

c) Abdul Karim Bin Mohamed Kuppai Khan (“Karim”) (35-year-old male Singapore
Citizen), an inmate at Tanah Merah Prison at the material time.

2\. Sometime in October 2020, Karim was alleged to have received information on other inmates at Tanah Merah Prison from Helmy on four occasions. These included
information on other inmates’ age, residential address, criminal charges and the contact
details of their next-of-kin. Karim was also alleged to have received information on the
locations of several other inmates at Tanah Merah Prison from Fattahullah on six
occasions in 2020. In the same month, Karim was alleged to have also threatened another
inmate of Tanah Merah Prison with injury to the inmate’s family. For his actions, Karim
faces six charges for offences under Section 5(2) and punishable under Section 17(2) of
the Official Secrets Act, of which one charge is amalgamated, and an additional charge for
criminal intimidation which is an offence punishable under Section 506 of the Penal Code.

3\. As Helmy and Fattahullah were not authorised to communicate the said information
to Karim, this information was alleged to have been communicated in contravention of the
Official Secrets Act. For their actions:

a) Helmy faces four charges for offences under Section 5(1)(e)(i) and punishable
under Section 17(2) of the Official Secrets Act; and

b) Fattahullah faces two charges for offences under Section 5(1)(e)(i) and
punishable under Section 17(2) of the Official Secrets Act, of which one charge
is amalgamated. Fattahullah also faces an additional charge for an offence
punishable under Section 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act for allegedly
accessing data relating to an inmate’s location at Tanah Merah Prison without
authorisation on 11 October 2020.

4\. The case was referred to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) by the
SPS.

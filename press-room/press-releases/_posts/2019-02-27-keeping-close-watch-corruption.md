Companies and their employees are expected to keep a close watch to ensure that business dealings are conducted in a fair and transparent manner, instead of turning to corrupt practices.

3\.        Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to give or accept bribes from another individual or entity.

The preservation of business interests should be done in an honest and transparent manner. Individuals should not resort to corrupt means to ensure good business relations.

2\.        On 8 January 2020, Pang Theng Wei (“Pang”) (45-year-old Singaporean), a former Assistant Sales Manager at United E&P Pte Ltd (“UEP”), was charged with four counts of corruptly obtaining gratification amounting to about $7,000 between April and August 2017 from one Yeo Boon Huat (“Andy”), a Director at Yew Ban Heng Construction Pte Ltd (“YBH"), as an inducement to not jeopardise the business relationship between YBH and UEP. This constitutes an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Cap 241. UEP is in the business of laying asphalt premixes and resurfacing of road surfaces whereas YBH is in the business of road-marking works. 

3\.         Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

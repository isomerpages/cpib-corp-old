On 16 November 2022, two men were charged in Court for allegedly committing corruption, falsification, and forgery offences. They are:

b) **Wee Bian Kiat (“Bian Kiat”)** (黄连吉, 59-year-old male Singaporean), Mechanical and Electrical Manager of Asia Square Tower 1 Pte Ltd and Asia Square Tower 2 Pte Ltd (who is under the employ of Jones Lang LaSalle Property Management Pte Ltd), and Building Manager in Frasers Property Management Services Pte Ltd (“FPMS”) at the material time of the various offences.

*Alleged Corruption Offences*

2\. Sometime between March 2016 and October 2021, Han De was alleged to have corruptly given Bian Kiat gratification in the form of loans totalling S$150,950 over 74 occasions as an inducement to advance the business interests of A to Z with Asia Square Tower 1 Pte Ltd and FPMS.

3\. Sometime between July 2017 and March 2020, Han De was alleged to have prepared fictitious payment vouchers and invoices to account for the bribe monies withdrawn from A to Z’s bank account which were paid to Bian Kiat.

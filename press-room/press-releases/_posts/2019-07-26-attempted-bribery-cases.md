On 26 July 2019, one Long Jinlian (龙金连), a 45-year-old Singaporean female and owner of massage establishment “Nature Beauty & Therapy Centre” was charged in Court with corruptly offering S$200 to Wong Cheng Mei, a Senior Technical Executive with the Housing & Development Board (“HDB”), for Wong to exercise leniency during inspections conducted at the Nature Beauty & Therapy Centre.  This constitutes an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. The alleged corruption offence occurred on 6 December 2018.  

2\.          In a separate case, one Aliddy Bin Tangaris, a 35-year-old Malaysian male, was charged in Court on 18 July 2019 with offering RM50 to Danial Durham Bin Jalil, an officer with the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), for the latter to release him (Aliddy) from  custody. This constitutes an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. The alleged corruption offence occurred on 10 July 2019.  

3\.          The CPIB would like to commend both the HDB officer Wong Cheng Mei and the CNB officer Danial Durham Bin Jalil for rejecting the bribe offers. Their acts of integrity exemplify one of the core values of the Public Service. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to bribe or attempt to bribe public officers. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

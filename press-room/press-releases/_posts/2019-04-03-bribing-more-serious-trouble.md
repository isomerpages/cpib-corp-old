Drink-driving is a serious offence that poses serious threats to public safety. Any attempt to avoid arrest through bribery would only aggravate the wrongdoing.

2\.          On 3 April 2019, Chong Wei Kwong ("Chong") （張伟光）, a 48-year-old Singaporean male, was charged with one count of corruptly offering a gratification of $1000 to Staff Sergeant Low Wee Meng ("SSgt Low"), a Police Officer with the Singapore Police Force, as an inducement for SSgt Low to refrain from arresting Chong for an offence of drink-driving. This constitutes an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. The bribe was rejected by SSgt Low.

3\.           Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to bribe or attempt to bribe public officers. Any person who is convicted of corruption can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

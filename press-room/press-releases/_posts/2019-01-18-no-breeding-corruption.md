The giving or receiving of bribes is illegal. Employees should never give, receive, or solicit corrupt gratification.

2\.        On 18 January 2019, two former employees of a pest control company and a manager of a construction services company were charged in Court with the following:

**a) Tung Chee Keong (湯志强), 48-year-old male Singaporean, a Vector Control Worker of Killem Pest Pte Ltd (Killem), engaged by National Environment Agency (NEA) as a contractor at the material time.**

i. Five counts of abetment by engaging in a conspiracy with one Chandran Jeganathan (“Jeganathan”) to corruptly accept gratification totalling $1,000 from one Muthukaruppan Periyasamy (“Periyasamy”), a Site Manager of Ramo Industries Pte Ltd, as a reward for providing Periyasamy with advance notification of upcoming mosquito breeding inspections by Killem between May to August 2018. These constitute offences punishable under Section 6(a) read with Section 29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

ii. One count of corruptly attempting to obtain gratification of $1,000 from one Kok Chew Leong (“Kok”), a workplace safety and health officer of China Jingye Engineering Corporation Ltd, as an inducement to provide Kok with advance notification of upcoming mosquito breeding inspections by Killem, and turning a blind eye to mosquito breeding violations at a construction site. This constitutes an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

**b) Chandran Jeganathan, 30-year-old male Indian National, a Technician of Killem Pest Pte Ltd (Killem), engaged by NEA as a contractor at the material time.**

i. Five counts of abetment by engaging in a conspiracy with one Tung Chee Keong to corruptly accept gratification totalling $600 from one Muthukaruppan Periyasamy (“Periyasamy”), a Site Manager of Ramo Industries Pte Ltd, as a reward for providing Periyasamy with advance notification of upcoming mosquito breeding inspections by Killem between May to August 2018. These constitute offences punishable under Section 6(a) read with Section 29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

**c) Muthukaruppan Periyasamy, 51-year-old male Indian National, a Manager of Fenzhii Engineering Services Pte Ltd at the material time.**

i. Five counts of corruptly giving gratification totalling $1,600 to Tung Chee Keong and Chandran Jeganathan, as a reward for providing advance notification of upcoming mosquito breeding inspections by Killem between May and August 2018. These constitute offences punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.        Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to bribe another individual. Corrupt acts which compromise mosquito breeding controls can pose a serious danger to public health safety. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

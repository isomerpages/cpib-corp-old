When employees place their personal gains above the interest of their employer, no amount of good procurement systems can stop unfair advantages and corrupt practices.

2\.    On 11 March 2015, Goh Keng Hwee Henry (Goh), a former Technical Officer with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and Changi Airport Group (Singapore) Pte Ltd (CAG), will be charged in Court for 6 counts of corruptly accepting gratification under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241 and 22 counts of knowingly deceiving CAAS/CAG with quotations that were not intended to be genuine offers under Section 6(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.    The charges alleged that between October 2008 and early 2011, Goh had accepted gratification amounting to at least $43,780 from Kang Leong Chuan (Kang), a director of M/s FireMech Pte Ltd (Fire-Mech), in return for assisting Fire-Mech to secure multiple contracts with the CAAS/ CAG and for giving Kang extra time to prepare quotations for the work required by CAAS/CAG.

4\.    As for the charges under Section 6(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241, Goh had during this period, also used false quotations (sourced by Kang) with the intention to deceive and mislead CAAS/CAG that Fire-Mech had provided the cheapest quotes for the work required. Subsequently CAAS/CAG was misled into believing that the quotations (provided by Fire-Mech) were indeed the cheapest and awarded the contracts to them.

5\.    The respective charges are attached for reference.

6\.    Singapore has always adopted a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) takes a serious view of any corrupt practices, and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

Corruption can lead to serious consequences. For example, corrupt arrangements which facilitate unregulated dumping of waste at a construction worksite compromise safety and can lead to serious accidents. 
 
2\.      On 21 August 2019, two individuals were charged in court with the following offences:

**a) Jeffrey Chin Jen Len (陳健麟， 50-year-old, male Malaysian), a Site Supervisor of Koon Construction & Transport Co. Pte Ltd (“Koon”) at the material time.**

* 32 counts of corruptly accepting gratification from various drivers, totalling around S$89,920, as inducement for Chin to allow vehicles to dump waste at Koon’s Sengkang West worksite. These constitute offences punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. The alleged offences were committed in 2017.

**b) Low Kong Yew (刘刚耀， 31-year-old, male Malaysian), a Lorry Driver of Seaview Transport Management Pte Ltd at the material time.**

* 15 counts of corruptly giving gratification totalling around S$44,700 to Jeffrey Chin Jen Len, a site Supervisor of Koon Construction & Transport Co. Pte Ltd, as inducement for Chin to allow vehicles to dump waste at Koon’s Sengkang West worksite. These constitute offences punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. The alleged offences were committed in 2017.

3\.      Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to give or receive bribes from another individual or entity. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

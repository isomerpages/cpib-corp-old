On 17 July 2017, Yu Xiaorong, a Chinese national, was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment for attempting to bribe a police officer.

2\.         Yu had pleaded guilty on 14 June 2017 to one charge of corruptly offering gratification of S$1,000 to Inspector Lam Wai Kit, a police officer attached to the Jurong Police Division, an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Cap 241. The gratification was offered as an inducement to refrain from taking enforcement action against Yu’s illegal bookmaking activities.

3\.         The incident occurred on 17 July 2016 when Yu was arrested at the Singapore Turf Club for illegal bookmaking activities. During the recording of her statement at Jurong Police Division, Yu offered S$1,000 to Inspector Lam to give her a chance and cease enforcement action against her. Inspector Lam rejected the bribe, and a report was subsequently made with the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau.

4\.         In Singapore, it is an offence to bribe, or attempt to bribe, public officers. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both.

5\.         Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

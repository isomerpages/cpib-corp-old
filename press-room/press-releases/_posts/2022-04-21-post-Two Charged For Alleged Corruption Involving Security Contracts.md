On 21 April 2022, two individuals will be charged in Court for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act. They are:

a) **Muhamed Haris S/O K A Bahrudeen Shah (“Haris”)** (47-year-old Singaporean male), Senior Business Development Manager in the employment of KH Security Pte Ltd (“KH Security”) at the material time; and

b) **Vicneshwaranathan S/O Ramanathan (“Nathan”)** (51-year-old Singaporean male), Chief Executive Officer of Assured Protection & Consultancy Pte Ltd (“APC”) at the material time.

2\.         Between 22 October 2018 and 2 October 2020, Haris had allegedly obtained gratification totalling about $33,000 on 38 occasions from Nathan through APC, as rewards for referring potential business with *Trans Eurokars Pte Ltd, Hillside World Academy, Worldwide Hotels Pte Ltd, Centurion Corporation Ltd or Labourtel Management Corporation Pte Ltd* to Nathan, which was a breach of Haris’ duties as Senior Business Development Manager of KH Security. For his alleged actions, Haris faces six charges punishable under Section 6(a) of the *Prevention of Corruption Act*, of which five charges are amalgamated pursuant to Section 124(4) of the *Criminal Procedure Code*, Chapter 68.

Employees should not resort to obtaining bribes as a way to line their pockets. All business transactions should be conducted fairly and transparently.

2\.      On 25 January 2019, Hong Eng Lam (洪永南), a 57-year-old former logistics manager at Hsing Loong Management Pte Ltd (“Hsing Loong”), was charged with 7 counts of corruptly obtaining gratification amounting to $21,400 from employees of JPN Industrial Trading Pte Ltd, Nordic Lift-Truck Pte Ltd and Cycle and Carriage Industries Pte Ltd as rewards for recommending Hsing Loong to make purchases of generators, welding sets, tippers and a forklift from these companies. These constitute offences punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.      Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to obtain bribes, or attempt to obtain bribes from another individual or entity. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

On 12 December 2022, the following three men were charged in Court for allegedly committing cheating and road traffic offences:

a) **Teoh Sio Meng (“Teoh”)**(张小明, 50-year-old male Singaporean), Director, T & L Transit Pte Ltd at the material time;

b) **Sundram S/O Retnam (“Sundram”)** (50-year-old male Singaporean), Sole Proprietor, SV Bus Transportation Services at the material time; and

c) **Tee Wei Chye (“Tee”)** (郑伟财, 44-year-old male Singaporean), Mechanic, Leng Chong Engineering at the material time.

***Alleged Cheating Offences***

*(i) Alleged Cheating Offences Relating to Vicom Ltd*

2\. Between June 2017 and January 2018, on two occasions, Teoh, Sundram, and Tee were alleged to have conspired to deceive a vehicle inspector from Vicom Ltd into believing that a working speed limiter had been installed and remained on the bus (which would comply with the law) when they knew that this fact was false, thereby intentionally inducing the vehicle inspector to pass the bus for the Police Speed Limiter Test.

*(ii) Alleged Cheating Offences Relating to the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”)*

3\. Sometime between July 2015 to January 2018, Teoh (on eight occasions) and Sundram (on one occasion) were alleged to have deceived the LTA into believing that there were working speed limiters installed on various buses when there were none, thereby intentionally inducing the LTA to allow licence and road tax to be renewed for those buses.

4\. In June 2017, on two occasions, Teoh was alleged to have instigated one Muhammad Sukri Bin Sulaimi to deceive the LTA into believing that there were working speed limiters installed on two buses when there were none, thereby intentionally inducing the LTA to allow those buses to be used in Singapore.

5\. Sometime on or about 17 April 2018, Tee was alleged to have deceived the LTA into believing that there was a cab partition installed in a minibus for the purpose of complying with the law when he intended to remove it after inspection. On the same day, Tee was also alleged to have deceived the LTA into believing that another bus did not emit smoke density more than 40HSU (which would comply with the law) when Tee had intended to adjust the air-to-fuel ratio in the fuel pump of the bus after the inspection. Tee’s alleged deceptions intentionally induced the LTA to allow licence and road tax to be renewed for both buses.

***Alleged Road Traffic Offences***

6\. Sometime on or before June 2017, Tee was alleged to have adjusted the speed limiter in a bus, allowing the speed of the bus to exceed 60km/h. On the same date, Sundram had not only failed to ensure that the speed limiter (in the same bus) did not exceed the stipulated limit, but knowingly driven it with the adjusted speed limiter.

7 For their alleged actions, the three men face the following charges:

**(a) Teoh Sio Meng**

(i) Twelve charges for offences punishable under Section 417 of the Penal Code, of which four charges are read with Section 109 of the said Code.

(iii) One charge under Rule 6(2) punishable under Rule 11(a) of the Road Traffic (Motor Vehicles, Speed Limiters) Rules.

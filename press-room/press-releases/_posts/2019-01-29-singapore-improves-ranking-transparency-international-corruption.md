The Transparency International (TI) Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) for 2018 has ranked Singapore 3rd out of 180 countries with a score of 85. This is an improvement from the 2017 TI-CPI results where Singapore was ranked the 6th least corrupt country in the world with a score of 84 points.

2\.      The TI-CPI ranks and measures countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption. The 2018 index draws upon 13 expert assessments and surveys of business people. Countries are then scored on a scale of zero, for highly corrupt, to 100, for very clean. 

3\.      The corruption situation remains under control in Singapore with the low numbers of complaints received and cases registered for investigation in recent years. Our good standing is also attested to by other global indicators. In Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC)’s 2018 Report on Corruption in Asia, Singapore has continued to rank as the least corrupt country in the region, a position it has held since 1995. Singapore was also ranked 4th for absence of corruption in the 2017-2018 Rule of Law Index compiled by the World Justice Project (WJP), the top Asian nation out of 113 countries.

4\.      “The Singapore Public Service continues to be recognised as one of the most efficient and cleanest in the world. Incidence of public sector corruption remains low with an average of 8 public sector employees prosecuted for corruption and related offences over the last three years. Working hand-in-hand with all stakeholders and the community, the CPIB remains committed and resolute in the fight against corruption.” said Mr Denis Tang, Director CPIB.

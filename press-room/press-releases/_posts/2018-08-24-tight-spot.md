On 24 August 2018, one Zhang Junli was sentenced to three weeks’ imprisonment for corruption.

2\.        Zhang, a 41-year-old Chinese national, had earlier been charged on 16 August 2018 with one count of corruptly offering gratification to an officer with the Certis Cisco Auxiliary Police Force Pte Ltd (Certis Cisco), an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.        Investigations had revealed that on 19 January 2018, Chan Chee Ming, a Certis Cisco Compliance Officer engaged by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), had found that Zhang’s unit at Pinevale Condominium was converted into a dormitory accommodation without approval, which is a breach of URA housing rules. Zhang took out an S$50 note from her pocket and tried to offer it to Officer Chan as an inducement not to report the breach to the URA. The bribe was rejected by Officer Chan and the matter was reported to the CPIB.

4\.        Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

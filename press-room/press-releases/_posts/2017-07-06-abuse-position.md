It is against the law for individuals to abuse their position of authority and solicit gratification from those under their charge.

2\.        On 6 July 2017, one Kobi Krishna S/O Ayavoo, a Prison Officer with the Singapore Prison Service, will be charged with eight counts of corruptly attempting to obtain gratification from one Chong Keng Chye, as an inducement to facilitate Chong Keng Chyeâ€™s request to transfer to a different prison institution, an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. The alleged gratification includes loans of up to $70,000 and cash amounting to $11,000.

3\.        Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

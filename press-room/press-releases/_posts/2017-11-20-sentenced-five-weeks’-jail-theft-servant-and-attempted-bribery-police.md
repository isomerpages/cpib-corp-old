On 20 November 2017, one Devika Maruvan, a Malaysian national, was sentenced to five weeks’ imprisonment for theft as a servant, as well as her attempt to bribe a Singapore Police Officer.

2\.        Maruvan had been charged in court on 28 August 2017 with one count of corruptly offering an unspecified amount to Sergeant Lim Mei Jing of the Singapore Police Force, as an inducement not to arrest her for the offence of theft as servant, an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.        Devika Maruvan had also been charged with eleven separate counts of theft as a servant, punishable under section 381 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

4\.        Investigations had revealed that on 26 June 2017, Maruvan, a salesperson at Rose Fashions at Tekka Centre, had offered money to Sergeant Lim to avoid being placed under arrest for the offence of theft as a servant. Sergeant Lim rejected the offer and proceeded to arrest Maruvan. The attempted bribery was subsequently referred to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).

5\.        In Singapore, it is an offence to bribe or attempt to bribe public officers. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both.

6\.        Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The CPIB takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

On 10 November 2021, two individuals will be charged in Court for corruption. They are:

* Muraleindren S/O Thoondy (“Murale”) (52-year-old male Singapore Citizen), and

* Sinevigneshwaraneckman S/O Many (“Vignesh”) (40-year-old male Singapore Citizen).

2\.	Sometime in August 2015, Murale was alleged to have corruptly given S$10,000 to Santhiran S/O Mayalagu (“Santhiran”), as a reward for Santhiran and his brother, Surash S/O Mayalagu (“Surash”) to give false evidence in the form of Statutory Declarations for judicial proceedings in a case involving Murale. For his action, Murale will be charged for an offence punishable under Section 5(b)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. In the same period, Vignesh was alleged to have abetted Murale in corruptly giving the S$10,000 to Santhiran and Surash. For his action, Vignesh will be charged for an offence punishable under Section 5(b)(i) read with Section 29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. 

3\.	On 16 January 2020, Santhiran and Surash were each sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment for giving false evidence in their Statutory Declarations, an offence under Section 193 of the Penal Code.

4\.	The case was referred to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”) by the Attorney-General’s Chambers.

5\.	 Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both.

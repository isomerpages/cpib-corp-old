On 6 April 2021, two former senior National Parks Board (“NParks”) officers will be charged for alleged corruption:

b) **Go Kau Chai Johnny (“Johnny”)** (吴九财, 51-year-old male Singaporean), who was Director of NParks’ MLD at the time of offence.

2\.        In 2018, Teva and Johnny allegedly accepted gratification in the form of hotel stay worth $258.42 as an inducement to advance the business interest of the giver’s company with NParks. The act was allegedly committed in the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China. For their actions, Teva and Johnny each face one charge for offences punishable under section 6(a) read with sections 7 and 37 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.        On six incidents between 2018 and 2020, Teva also allegedly obtained gratification in the form of transport services as an inducement to advance the business interest of a second giver’s company with NParks. For his actions, Teva faces one charge for an offence punishable under section 6(a) read with section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241 and amalgamated pursuant to section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapter 68.

4\.        Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption, including any corrupt acts committed overseas. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both. The maximum imprisonment term for each offence of corruption can be increased to 7 years if it is in relation to a matter or contract with the Government or public body, or a subcontract to execute work comprised in such contract.

On 5 June 2017, one Ng Lam Siong was sentenced to one week imprisonment and fined $5,000 for attempting to bribe a public officer with the National Environment Agency (NEA).

2\.          Ng had earlier been charged on 18 January 2017 for corruptly offering gratification of S$50 to Muhammad Kamil bin Mohamad Noh, an Environmental Health Officer with the NEA, to refrain from reporting on some of the mosquito breeding areas discovered at 2 Sungei Kadut Street 3, an offence under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.          Investigations had revealed that on 25 August 2016, the Environmental Health Officer had discovered mosquito breeding at the premises of Sin Lam Bee Sawmill Pte Ltdâ€™s factory, of which Ng was a director and shareholder. As this was not the first time that Ng has committed such an offence, he attempted to bribe the officer into reporting a lesser number of breeding grounds so as to avoid a hefty fine. The bribe was rejected by Muhammad Kamil bin Mohamad Noh, and the matter was subsequently reported to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau.

4\.          In Singapore, it is an offence to bribe, or attempt to bribe public officers. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both.

5\.          Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

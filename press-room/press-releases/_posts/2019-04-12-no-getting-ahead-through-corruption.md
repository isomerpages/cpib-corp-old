Individuals seeking to advance business interests should do so in an honest and transparent manner. Engaging in corrupt acts will only land one in serious trouble with the law.

2\.     On 12 April 2019, Mohamed Ali Bin Mohamed Yusoff (“Mohamed Ali”) (59-year-old Singaporean), an operations manager with Aldino Freight & Trading Pte Ltd (“Aldino”), was charged with one count of corruptly obtaining gratification amounting to about $14,000 from one Sharul Hisham Bin Seran, an operations manager in the employ of Rich Growth Logistics Pte Ltd (“Rich Growth”), to advance the business interest of Rich Growth with Aldino. This occurred on 55 occasions between August 2015 and October 2017. The charge was amalgamated pursuant to section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed). This offence is punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241, 1993 Rev Ed).

3\.      Mohamed Ali was also charged with two counts of criminal breach of trust as a servant for dishonestly converting company cheques belonging to Aldino (totalling about $136,000) to his own use by depositing the cheques into his own bank account. These constitute offences punishable under section 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

4\.      Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption and other criminal activities. It is a serious offence to obtain or attempt to obtain bribes from any individual or entity. It is also a serious offence to commit criminal breach of trust while being a servant of a company. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both. Any person who is convicted of an offence of criminal breach of trust as a servant can be sentenced to imprisonment of up to 15 years and a fine.

On 22 December 2016, Ling Chun Teck Donald, a Singaporean company director of TAC Contracts Pte Ltd operating in the waterproofing and general works industry, was sentenced to 30 months’ imprisonment for corruption offences. 

2\.         Investigations showed that Ling had been giving corrupt payments to his clients, which include managing agents, contractors and property agents, when his company TAC Contracts Pte Ltd won the jobs with them. These payments were made under the guise of referral fees, commissions, or tokens of appreciation, and were given in cash either personally by the accused or his sales’ staff to his clients.

3\.         On 24 October 2016, Ling pleaded guilty to six charges under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241 for corruptly giving gratification, as well as 14 charges of corruptly giving gratification with common intention under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241, read with Section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. Another 517 charges have been taken into consideration during sentencing.

4\.          Ling was previously charged in Court on 29 June 2016 for 121 counts of corruptly giving gratification amounting to at least $145,353.00 to 31 employees from various companies, an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. These monies were given as an inducement for advancing the business interest of TAC Contracts Pte Ltd.

5\.          Ling had also faced 416 charges of corruptly giving gratification amounting to at least $316,281.10, each with common intention together with one of his 12 sales staff, in order to advance the business interests of TAC Contracts Pte Ltd. These charges are punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241, read with Section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. These monies were given to 76 employees from various organisations so that TAC Contracts Pte Ltd can be awarded with the jobs and contracts with these organisations. 

6\.          Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption and any criminal activity. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

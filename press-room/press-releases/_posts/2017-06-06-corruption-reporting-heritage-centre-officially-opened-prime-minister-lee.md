The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) Corruption Reporting & Heritage Centre (CRHC) was officially opened by Guest of Honour Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 6 June 2017.

2\.          Located at 247 Whitley Road, Singapore 297830, the CRHC was set up as a convenient and accessible space for members of the public to lodge corruption complaints and to learn about corruption matters. During opening hours, an on-site Duty Officer will be available to speak with individuals who are lodging reports on corruption. Interested public may also walk-in and do a self-guided tour at the CPIB Heritage Centre which traces Singapore’s and the Bureau’s journey in battling the venal. A modern and interactive multimedia gallery, it also features oral interviews of CPIB officers past and present in addition to preserved case exhibits artefacts. The CRHC is one of recent initiatives that the CPIB has undertaken to reach out to the community and the public.

3\.           During the opening, Prime Minister Lee also presented prizes to the top winners of the #IfILiveInDarkness Story Writing Competition which was launched on the International Anti-Corruption Day last year. The competition, which ran for 4 months, received an overwhelming 275 entries across Secondary Schools, Junior Colleges, Polytechnics and Institutes of Technical Education. Students had been invited to write a short story on how life would be for them, their family and friends if they lived in a city tainted with corruption, greed and decadence. The list of winners for the competition is attached at Annex A.

4\.           As Director CPIB puts it, “the Corruption Reporting & Heritage Centre (CRHC) expands the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau’s (CPIB) anti-corruption efforts by creating an accessible space for the public to report and learn about corruption. The Bureau remains committed and resolute in the fight against corruption, and will work closely with the community to eradicate the scourge of corruption in Singapore“.

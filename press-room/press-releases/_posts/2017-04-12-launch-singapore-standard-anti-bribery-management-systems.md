***SPRING and CPIB launch SS ISO 37001 to help Singapore companies looking to internationalise manage corruption risk***

SPRING Singapore and the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) launched the Singapore Standard (SS) ISO 37001 on Anti-bribery management systems – Requirements with guidance for use today. Companies in Singapore can enhance their anti-bribery controls by adopting SS ISO 37001. The voluntary standard that is based on internationally-recognised good practices provides guidelines to help Singapore companies strengthen their anti-bribery compliance systems and processes and ensure compliance with anti-bribery laws (Refer to factsheet for more information on SS ISO 37001).

2\. Singapore has built a reputation as a trusted hub for business and trade contributing to our economic growth over the last 50 years. This would not be possible without a clean and incorrupt system set in place by strong political will. To seize the opportunities of the future economy, it is imperative for Singapore companies to venture overseas. SS ISO 37001 allows these companies to benchmark the integrity of their governance processes against international standards and practices. This will increase trust and confidence in their products and services and boost their competitiveness in global markets.

3\.            SS ISO 37001 is a national adoption of ISO 37001:2016 – Anti-bribery management systems – Requirements with guidance for use which was published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). ISO 37001 represents a global consensus of good practices of public and private sectors organisations. It was developed by an ISO committee comprising representatives from 61 countries including Singapore. Singapore was represented by the Working Group on Anti-Bribery Management Systems  led by the CPIB and comprised of 11 representatives from businesses, trade associations and chambers,  academia, and government bodies.
 
4\.            Mr Wong Hong Kuan, Director, Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, and Convenor of Working Group for Anti-Bribery Management Systems said, “With the operating environment becoming more complex, and corruption cases more transnational in nature, adopting the new SS ISO 37001 standard will help Singapore companies safeguard against bribery. Each of us has a part to play in making Singapore corruption-free so that it remains an attractive place for businesses and investments.”

5\.            The requirements for SS ISO 37001 are generic and can be adopted by any organisation. SS ISO 37001 is based on a similar framework as other widely used ISO management systems standards like SS ISO 9001 for quality management and SS ISO 14001 for environmental management. This makes it easier for organisations to integrate SS ISO 37001 with these standards. Used together, they help organisations gain a competitive edge through developing quality products and services, raising productivity through increased efficiency and increasing market and trade opportunities.

6\.            “By adopting SS ISO 37001, our companies will gain an additional stamp of confidence in their systems and processes to help them grow beyond Singapore’s shores. To encourage local enterprises to adopt the standard, SPRING will be working with public and private stakeholders to provide assistance in terms of training, consultancy, certification and funding,” said Ms Choy Sauw Kook, Assistant Chief Executive, Quality & Excellence, SPRING Singapore. 

7\.             Mr Kho Choon Keng, Council Member of Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry (SCCCI) and Group Executive Chairman of Lian Huat Group said, “Being a trusted business partner and having a trustable business partner is an essential factor to business success. I believe that by adopting the SS ISO 37001, it will give home-grown companies a competitive advantage over others when it comes to business deals internationally.”  

8\.             Mr Adrian Chan, Honorary Secretary of the Association of Small & Medium Enterprises (ASME) said, “To remain competitive in the future economy, SMEs have to enter new markets and internationalise. This standard helps SMEs level the playing field against large organisations and foreign firms when bidding for projects or procuring for services. It assures customers and suppliers that Singapore SMEs have good anti-bribery practices that are benchmarked against global best practices.” 

9\.              A senior supply chain executive from a major US Oil & Gas company said, “Most multinational corporations (MNCs) operating in Singapore have to comply with strict US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) guidelines. The new SS ISO 37001 standard will help MNCs’ local partners and suppliers align with these guidelines and also provide them with a new level of assurance, saving them the need to audit and qualify these companies before working with them.”

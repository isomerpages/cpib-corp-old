<p>On 26 January 2024, Poo Tze Chiang (“Poo”) (符志强, 46-year-old male Singaporean),
a Police Officer of the Singapore Police Force (“SPF”) at the material
time, faced additional corruption and cheating charges in Court. Poo was
earlier charged on 22 November 2022 for allegedly committing corruption
and obstruction of justice offences. Another individual, Chen Guangyun
(“Chen”) (陈光云, 37-year-old male Chinese National) was also charged in connection
to Poo’s alleged offences.</p>
<p><em>Alleged Corruption Offences</em>
</p>
<p>2. It is alleged that, on three occasions between July and October 2019,
Poo corruptly obtained, for himself or for the benefit of an unknown SPF
officer, gratifications totalling S$18,000 from Chen, who was being investigated
for offences under the Immigration Act. These gratifications were allegedly
meant as inducements for Poo, or the said SPF officer, to help Chen reduce
punishment or avoid prosecution for these offences.</p>
<p>3. It is further alleged that, over six other occasions between August
2019 and January 2020, Poo corruptly obtained further gratifications totalling
S$18,000 from Chen as an inducement to help Chen remain in Singapore after
being convicted of a criminal offence.</p>
<p>4. For their alleged actions, Poo and Chen each face four charges for
offences punishable under Section 6(a) and 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption
Act respectively, of which one charge is amalgamated under Section 124(4)
of the Criminal Procedure Code read with Section 124(8)(a)(ii) of the same
Code.</p>
<p><em>Alleged Cheating Offence</em>
</p>
<p>5. Sometime in September 2020, Poo was alleged to have knowingly deceived
Chen into believing that Poo required S$10,000 to apply to two Singapore
government agencies for Chen to be granted permission to return to Singapore.
As such, Chen was induced to pay S$10,000 to Poo. For his action, Poo faces
one additional charge for an offence punishable under Section 420 of the
Penal Code.</p>
<p>6. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the Prevention
of Corruption Act can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment
of up to five years or to both. Any person convicted of an offence under
Section 420 of the Penal Code can be sentenced to imprisonment of up to
10 years, and also be liable to a fine.</p>

On 27 July 2016, Khatijah Bte A. Manap, a Singaporean who had worked as a clerk for the Traffic Police, was sentenced to 18 weeks' imprisonment and ordered to pay a penalty of $2,500 for corruption, and offences under the Official Secrets Act.

2\.          Investigations showed that Khatijah had corruptly received gratification amounting to some $2,500 from one Gulzar Raja Singh Sandhu, as a reward for revealing the contact details of traffic accident victims. She had pleaded guilty on 7 June 2016, to a total of 5 charges under Section 5(1)(e)(i) of the Official Secrets Act (OSA), Chapter 213 for communicating, without authorization, information obtained through her position as a clerk at Traffic Police Investigation Branch, as well as 3 charges of corruptly receiving gratification under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA), Chapter 241. Another 18 charges under the OSA and 5 charges under the PCA have been taken into consideration during sentencing.

3\.          Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption and criminal activity. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau takes a serious view of any corrupt practices, and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service, Mr Chan Chun Sing, delivered Singapore’s statement via a pre-recorded video at the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on Corruption held from 2 to 4 June 2021 in New York. The special session focused on challenges and measures to prevent and fight corruption as well as the strengthening of international cooperation.

2\.        Minister Chan outlined Singapore’s four-pronged approach to keep corruption at bay: a strong political will to fight corruption in any form; robust anti-corruption laws; effective enforcement by an impartial Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau; and an efficient Public Service with a strong ethos of serving our people. Despite Singapore having some success in combating corruption, Minister Chan reiterated that there was no room for complacency as the corruption threat is always evolving. In this regard, Singapore must leverage science and technology to prevent and combat sophisticated forms of corruption.

3\.        Minister Chan reaffirmed Singapore’s full commitment to the United Nations Convention against Corruption and to working with the global community to tackle corruption through multilateral partnerships such as the International Anti-Corruption Coordination Centre of which Singapore is a founding member. 

4\.        A Political Declaration setting out the global commitment to effectively fight corruption and strengthen international cooperation was also adopted by consensus at the UNGASS on Corruption.

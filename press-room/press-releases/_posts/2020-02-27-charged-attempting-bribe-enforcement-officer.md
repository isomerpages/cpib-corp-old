Motorists should never try to bribe their way out of traffic offences. Any attempt to do so would only land one into more serious trouble with the law.

2\.        On 27 February 2020, Wang Baoyu (“Wang”), 王保玉, a 40-year-old male PRC National Work Permit holder, was charged with one count of corruptly offering $50/- to a former Certis CISCO Auxiliary Police Force Pte Ltd (“CISCO”) Enforcement Officer Muhammad Ridhwan Bin Razali (“Ridhwan”), as an inducement to refrain from issuing a summons to Wang for parking illegally. This constituted an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. Wang, a driver in the employment of Poh Tiong Choon Logistics Limited at the material time, committed the offence on 1 April 2019.

3\.        The CPIB would like to commend Ridhwan for his act of integrity by rejecting the bribe, which exemplifies one of the core values of our society. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to offer bribes, or attempt to offer bribes to another individual or entity. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

4\.       The CPIB looks into all corruption complaints and reports, including anonymous ones, and can be reached via the following channels:

a) Write to us at the CPIB Headquarters @ 2 Lengkok Bahru, S159047 or Corruption Reporting & Heritage Centre @ 247 Whitley Road S297830;<br />
b) Call the Duty Officer at 1800-376-0000;<br />

d) Email us at <a class="spamspan" href="mailto:report@cpib.gov.sg">report@cpib.gov.sg</a>

5\.        Where possible, the report should include the following information:

a) Where, when and how the alleged corrupt act happened?<br />
b) Who was involved and what were their roles?<br />
c) What was the bribe given and the favour shown?

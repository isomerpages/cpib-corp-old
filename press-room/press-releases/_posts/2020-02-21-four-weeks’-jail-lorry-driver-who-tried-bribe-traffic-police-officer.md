Motorists must abide by traffic rules and will have to bear the consequences of any violation. Attempting to bribe one’s way out will result in more serious repercussion.         

2\.       On 21 February 2020, Teo Teck Yong, a 62-year-old Singaporean lorry driver, was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment for attempting to bribe a Traffic Police Officer. Teo was charged in Court on 27 November 2019 for corruptly offering $100 to Sergeant Shivasuria s/o Maniam Kesaval (“Sgt Shivasuria”), as an inducement to not issue a traffic summon to Teo for failing to wear a seat belt while driving. This constituted an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.        Investigations revealed that on 18 August 2019, Sgt Shivasuria had spotted Teo driving a lorry without his seat belt fastened and signalled for Teo to stop the vehicle. Teo persistently offered S$100 to Sgt Shivasuria, to refrain from issuing Teo a traffic summon. Sgt Shivasuria rejected Teo’s offer and the matter was reported to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).

4\.        The CPIB would like to commend Sgt Shivasuria for his act of integrity which exemplifies one of the core values of the Public Service. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to bribe, or attempt to offer bribes to another individual or entity. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

5\.       The CPIB looks into all corruption complaints and reports, including anonymous ones, and can be reached via the following channels:

a) Write to us at the CPIB Headquarters @ 2 Lengkok Bahru, S159047 or Corruption Reporting & Heritage Centre @ 247 Whitley Road S297830;<br />
b) Call the Duty Officer at 1800-376-0000;<br />

d) Email us at <a class="spamspan" href="mailto:report@cpib.gov.sg">report@cpib.gov.sg</a>

6\.        Where possible, the report should include the following information:

a) Where, when and how the alleged corrupt act happened?<br />
b) Who was involved and what were their roles?<br />
c) What was the bribe given and the favour shown?

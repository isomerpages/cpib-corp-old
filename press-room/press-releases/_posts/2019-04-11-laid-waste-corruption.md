Corrupt acts can harm our environment and compromise public health. Individuals who engage in such acts must bear the full brunt of the law. 

2\.          On 11 April 2019, two individuals were charged with the following corrupt offences: 

**a)    Ali Bin Mohamed, a 59-year-old cleaner employed by Yong Xiang Pte Ltd**

i.    Seven counts of corruptly giving gratification amounting to $210 to one Tan Kok Siong as a reward for having allowed the illegal disposal of general waste at a Bin Centre in Tampines. This constituted an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

**b)    Tan Kok Siong, a 55-year-old Supervisor employed by Clean Solutions Pte Ltd**

i.    Seven counts of corruptly accepting gratification amounting to $210 from Ali Bin Mohamed, as a reward for allowing him to illegally dispose general waste at a Bin Centre in Tampines. This constituted an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.          Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to give or accept bribes from another individual or entity in return for favours. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

On 21 July 2015, Indonesian national Nasiruddin was sentenced to 30 months’ imprisonment for offences related to football match fixing activities at the 28th South East Asian (SEA) Games.

2\.        Nasiruddin was charged for engaging in a conspiracy with two other persons, including a Singapore citizen, to corruptly agree to give gratification to one Orlando Marques Henriques Mendes, a technical director of the Timor Leste Football Association, amounting to $15,000, as a reward to arrange for the Timor Leste football team to lose their match against Malaysia, an offence under Section 6(b) read with Section 29 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. Nasiruddin was also charged for being a party to a criminal conspiracy by agreeing to corruptly offer bribes to members of the Timor Leste football team as an inducement to lose the same match, an offence contrary to Section 5(b)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Chapter 241, 1993 Rev Ed), and punishable under Section 120B(1) of the Penal Code (Chapter 241, 2008 Rev Ed).

3\.        Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption, and match fixing of any form is not condoned in Singapore. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in match fixing related activities. The Bureau works with the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), the Football Association of Singapore (FAS), and other agencies to keep the local soccer scene clean.

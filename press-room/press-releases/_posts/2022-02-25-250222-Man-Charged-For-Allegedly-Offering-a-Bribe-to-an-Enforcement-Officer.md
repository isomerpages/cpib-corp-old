On 25 February 2022, Shen Qinglong (“Shen”) (沈庆龙) (32-year-old male People’s Republic of China national) will be charged in Court for alleged corruption.

2\. On 15 January 2022, Shen was moonlighting as a freelance delivery driver when he was stopped by Mathanakumar S/O Rawit Chendran (“Mathanakumar”), an Enforcement Officer of TS Group Pte Ltd who was deployed at Tuas View Dormitory. Shen allegedly offered Mathanakumar a S$200 bribe to allow Shen to leave the dormitory without recording his particulars and to refrain from reporting Shen to the relevant authorities for being a selfemployed foreigner working without a valid work pass in Singapore, which is an offence under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act. Mathanakumar rejected the bribe offer and the case was subsequently referred to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). For offering a bribe, Shen faces one charge punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1960.

3\. After Mathanakumar rejected the bribe offer, Shen tried to leave the scene in his van and drove over Mathanakumar’s foot in the process. For his action, Shen was earlier charged in Court by the Singapore Police Force (SPF) on 17 January 2022 for causing hurt by a rash act, an offence punishable under Section 337(a) of the Penal Code 1871.

4\. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both. 

5\. CPIB looks into all corruption complaints and reports, including anonymous ones, and can be reached via the following channels:

c) Call the Duty Officer at 1800-376-0000; or<br />

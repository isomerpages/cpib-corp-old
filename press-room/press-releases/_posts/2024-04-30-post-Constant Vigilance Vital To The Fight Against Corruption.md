<p><strong>Corruption Situation in Singapore Remains Firmly Under Control</strong>
</p>
<p>The corruption situation in Singapore remains firmly under control. The
number of corruption-related reports received by CPIB, as well as the number
of cases registered for investigation remained low. In 2023, CPIB received
215 corruption-related reports, an 8% decrease from the 234 corruption-related
reports received in 2022. Of these, CPIB registered 81 reports as new cases
for investigation. The percentage of corruption-related reports registered
for investigation in 2023 (38%) increased by 4% compared to the average
of the preceding 4 years (34%). <strong>(Figure 1)</strong>. A report is
registered for investigation if the information received is pursuable.
This is determined by the quality of relevant information provided. Investigative
enquiries and intelligence probes by CPIB also uncovered further information
that enabled a higher percentage of reports to be registered for investigation.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CPIB treats all reports received
seriously regardless of whether the complainant is named or anonymous.
Of the 215 corruption-related reports received in 2023, 98 (46%) were anonymous.
The merits of these reports were assessed based on the information provided.
Of the 81 cases registered for investigation in 2023, 20 (25%) were anonymous.</p>

<p><strong><em><u>Number of Public Sector Cases Remained Low</u></em></strong>
</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2023, most of the cases registered
for investigation <strong>(Figure 2)</strong> were from the private sector
(86%, 70 cases). Out of the 70 cases, 9 cases involved public sector employees
rejecting bribes offered by private sector individuals.<sup>1</sup> On the
other hand, public sector cases accounted for 14% of all cases (11 cases)
registered for investigation in 2023.</p>

<p><strong><em><u>Majority of Individuals Prosecuted in Court were from the Private Sector</u></em></strong>
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2023, 111 individuals were prosecuted
in Court for offences investigated by CPIB. Of these, 95% (105) were private
sector individuals while the remaining 5% (6) were public sector employees.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><u>High Clearance Rate for CPIB Cases</u></em></strong>
</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CPIB maintained a high clearance
rate<sup>2</sup>, completing investigation into 84% of subjects investigated
in 2023 (<strong>Figure 3</strong>).</p>

<p><strong><em><u>High Conviction Rate Maintained</u></em></strong>
</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The conviction rate for CPIB cases
in 2023 was maintained at 99% (<strong>Figure 4</strong>). The consistently
high conviction rate for CPIB cases is testament to the quality of the
Bureau’s investigation to be able to stand up to scrutiny in Court, as
well as the close working relationship between CPIB and the Attorney-General’s
Chambers (AGC) in bringing corrupt offenders to task.</p>

<p><strong>Constant Vigilance is Critical to a Clean and Incorruptible System &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CPIB, working together with a citizenry
attuned to the need for constant vigilance, must remain alert to ensure
that the Singapore system remains clean and incorruptible. CPIB is grateful
to vigilant members of the public as well as public officers who have readily
come forward with information of suspected wrongdoing, including anonymous
reports. This enables CPIB to investigate and uncover the truth so that
corruption is unable to take root in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Case 1 – Investigation against a Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who deceived his ministry through the misuse of the diplomatic bag service</em></strong>
</p>
<p>On 18 January 2023, CPIB received information from the Airport Police
Division that an officer from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), was
detected by the Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA), of having
brought back from China a package containing luxury watches during a check
conducted on his suitcase.</p>
<p>It was established that the MFA officer brought the package back at the
request of his colleague, Oh Hin Kwan Gilbert (Gilbert), a Director-General
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) not knowing that the package contained
luxury watches.</p>
<p>CPIB’s investigations revealed that Gilbert abetted the cheating of MFA
by instigating his colleague to dispatch the package of luxury watches
via the MFA’s diplomatic bag service, without disclosing that the package
belonged to and was intended for someone else, and not the said colleague.
CPIB’s investigations further revealed that Gilbert allegedly gave false
information concerning the ownership of the luxury watches to the Deputy
Secretary of MFA, by stating that the watches belonged to his (Gilbert’s)
father, when he knew this was not true.</p>
<p>CPIB’s investigations also found that sometime in December 2022, Gilbert
dishonestly concealed from the MFA that a package containing boxes of Panadol
sent from Singapore to his MFA colleague in Beijing via the diplomatic
bag service was intended for a personal acquaintance, rather than the said
MFA colleague. MFA was induced to accept the package for dispatch via the
diplomatic bag service on that basis, which it would not have done had
it known the truth.</p>
<p>On 23 November 2023, Gilbert was charged in Court for offences under the <em>Penal Code</em>.
His case is currently before the Court. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Case 2 – Investigation against a Director of the National Research Foundation for alleged corruption offences</em></strong>
</p>
<p>In 2021, the National Research Foundation (NRF) referred an anonymous
complaint to CPIB. The anonymous complaint alleged that Henry Wong Chuen
Yeung (Henry), a Director for Programmes and Central Innovation Cluster
of the NRF and a member of the Built Environment Technology Alliance (BETA)
Project Evaluation Panel at the material time, had accepted bribes.</p>
<p>The NRF is a department under the Prime Minister’s Office and BETA is
under the purview of the Building and Construction Authority.</p>
<p>CPIB acted on the complaint and subsequent investigations revealed that
Henry had allegedly agreed to accept 30% shareholding from Lee Tze Boon
(Lee), Director of Smart Illumination Pte Ltd (Smart Illumination), as
a reward for advancing Smart Illumination’s business interest in its application
for grant funding from BETA.</p>
<p>BETA has suspended the processing for Smart Illumination’s fund application
as a result of the investigations.</p>
<p>On 23 June 2023, Henry and Lee were charged in Court for an offence each
under the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>. Their cases are currently
before the Court.</p>
<p><strong><em>Case 3 - Investigation against 16 individuals for alleged corruption and cheating offences in relation to advertisement and servicing contracts</em></strong>
</p>
<p>In 2021, CPIB received information from a member of public alleging that
Low Lee Soon, Arts Director of Moove Media Pte Ltd had accepted bribes
on two occasions from Xu Zhiping, Shareholder of Channelbytes Pte Ltd,
Channelink Pte Ltd and Multiverse Media Ptd Ltd, and Hong Hoe Chun Jane,
Director of Channelbytes Pte Ltd, Channelink Pte Ltd and ChannelWerkz Pte
Ltd to advance the business interests of Channelbytes Pte Ltd and/or Channelink
Pte Ltd with Moove Media Pte Ltd and/or ComfortDelGro Corporation Ltd<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>In the course of the investigations into the three individuals above,
CPIB uncovered a complex web of corruption and cheating offences involving
13 more individuals and about S$825,000 worth of gratifications in relation
to advertisement and servicing contracts.</p>
<p>On 29 January 2024, all 16 individuals were charged in Court for offences
under the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Penal Code. Since then,
five individuals have been convicted and sentenced to pay fines ranging
from $6,000 to $33,000, while one has been sentenced to 64 weeks imprisonment
and ordered to pay a penalty of more than $476,000.00. The rest have their
cases pending before the Court.</p>
<p><strong><em>Case 4 – Investigation against five individuals for alleged corruption offences</em></strong>
</p>
<p>On 15 April 2021, CPIB received information via a walk-in complaint from
a member of the public regarding alleged corrupt practices by Ocean Enterprise
(INT) Pte Ltd.</p>
<p>Acting on the information, CPIB’s investigations revealed that between
February 2016 to November 2017, Yang Xiaoyi, Director of Ocean Enterprise
(INT) Pte Ltd (Ocean Enterprise) corruptly gave gratifications totalling
S$43,000 to Tan Kee Kok, Project Manager of ISOTEAM Projects Pte Ltd (ISOTeam
Projects) over seven occasions, in return for advancing the business interests
of Ocean Enterprise with ISOTeam Projects.</p>
<p>Further investigations also uncovered that Yang Xiaoyi conspired with
Lin Jinhua, Manager of Ocean Enterprise to corruptly give gratifications
totalling about S$10,200 to Nyo Bak Wei, Project Manager of Kemvet Commercial
Builders (Kemvet) over three occasions, and S$2,400 to Chan Chong Wai,
Project Manager of Hak Kian Enterprise Pte Ltd (Hak Kian) on one occasion,
between September 2015 to September 2016. These were in return for advancing
the business interests of Ocean Enterprise with Kemvet and Hak Kian.</p>
<p>The five individuals were charged in Court on 28 February 2023 for offences
under the Prevention of Corruption Act and they have since been convicted
and sentenced. Yang Xiaoyi, Lin Jun Hua, Chan Chong Wai, Tan Kee Kok were
fined $78,000, $18,000, $10,000 and $70,000, respectively. Nyo Bak Wei
was fined $30,000 and was also ordered to pay a penalty of $10,178.</p>
<p><strong><em>Case 5 – Investigation against S Iswaran for corruption and other offences</em></strong>
</p>
<p>While investigating a separate matter, CPIB came across some information
concerning former Minister for Transport, S Iswaran (Iswaran).</p>
<p>CPIB’s investigations revealed that Iswaran had allegedly corruptly obtained
gratification worth a total value of about $145,434 and $20,848.03 from
a Malaysian businessman, Ong Beng Seng (Ong) over two occasions in September
and December 2022, respectively. These were inducements for advancing Ong’s
business interests in matters relating to a contract between Singapore
GP Pte Ltd and the Singapore Tourism Board, and a proposal for a contract
with the Singapore Tourism Board. In addition, Iswaran also allegedly obtained,
as a public servant, valuable things amounting to a total value of about
$218,058.95 from Ong between November 2015 to December 2021 for no consideration.</p>
<p>CPIB’s investigations also revealed that between November 2021 and November
2022, Iswaran was alleged to have obtained, as a public servant, valuable
things with a total value of about $18,956.94 for no consideration from
Lum Kok Seng, whom Iswaran knew to be concerned in business transacted
which had a connection with his official function as Minister for Transport.</p>
<p>On 18 January 2024, Iswaran was charged in the State Courts for 27 charges
under the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act </em>and the <em>Penal Code.</em> Subsequently,
Iswaran was served with eight additional charges under section 165 of the <em>Penal Code </em>on
25 March 2024.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strong public trust in our leaders
and public institutions is a key tenet of our system of governance. It
must not be taken for granted. CPIB is fortunate to operate within a national
anti-corruption framework underpinned by firm and unwavering political
will to fight corruption, and a public which eschews corruption. Case 6
below, where CPIB was tasked by the Prime Minister to investigate the separate
rentals of Ridout Road bungalows by two serving Cabinet Ministers, was
testament to the strong commitment to uphold a system of governance with
a high standard of integrity and accountability.</p>
<p><strong><em>Case 6 – Investigation into the rental of Black and White Bungalows at 26 and 31 Ridout Road</em></strong>
</p>
<p>On 17 May 2023, the Bureau received instructions from the Prime Minister
to conduct investigations into the separate rentals of the Black and White
bungalows at 26 and 31 Ridout Road, which were tenanted to Minister (Home
Affairs) K Shanmugam and Minister (Foreign Affairs) Vivian Balakrishnan
respectively.</p>
<p>The primary objective of CPIB’s investigation was to ascertain if there
was any corruption or criminal wrongdoing(s) relating to the rentals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As disclosed during the Parliament sitting in July 2023, CPIB’s independent
and authoritative investigation did not reveal any corrupt intent on the
part of any person, or any inducement given to any individual involved
in the processing of the rental applications. CPIB found no preferential
treatment given to the Ministers and their spouses, no disclosure of privileged
information in the rental process, and no evidence to suggest any abuse
of position by the Ministers for personal gain.</p>
<p>CPIB however discovered that there was a lack of precision in the determination
of “Guide Rent” by Singapore Land Authority’s (SLA) for the rentals, which
led to an error in SLA’s public statement on 12 May 2023 which stated that
Minister Shanmugam had paid above the guide rent when the monthly rental
paid was in fact equal to the correct guide rent. While this has no bearing
on the fact that all transactions and communications were completely above
board, CPIB dutifully reported this as part of our factual findings.</p>
<p><strong>Instilling Incorruptibility into the DNA of Young Singaporeans</strong>
</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incorruptibility is a key part
of the Singaporean DNA. To preserve this important value amongst young
Singaporeans, CPIB continues to engage the community and youths to co-create
anti-corruption education programmes.</p>
<p><strong><em><u>Multi-level Collaboration with Singapore Polytechnic, Straits Times and AGC - The Corruption Casebook 2: Hidden Victims of Corruption</u></em></strong>
</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a multi-agency collaboration, CPIB
partnered with students from the Singapore Polytechnic Media, Arts &amp;
Design School, a journalist from The Straits Times and the AGC on a new
e-book for teenagers entitled <em>The Corruption Casebook 2: Hidden Victims of Corruption</em>.
This illustrative publication aims to educate their peers that corruption
is not a victimless crime through an art-style depiction of actual CPIB
cases. To complement the content, the e-book also features fresh insights
from AGC’s prosecutors on selected cases. Interactive activities, quizzes
and a glossary are other interesting features to enhance the learning value
of the e-book as a useful resource for the youth, their parents, and educators.
CPIB’s first publication of <em>The Corruption Casebook 2: Hidden Victims of Corruption</em> is
available for download on the CPIB website.</p>
<p><strong><em><u>Partnership with Uniformed Groups –Anti-Corruption Badge Programme</u></em></strong>
</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To enhance the education of young Singaporeans
on anti-corruption and the role each person plays to combat corruption,
CPIB partnered with the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) to implement
the Anti-Corruption Badge Programme (ACBP) in 2021. The ACBP was later
extended to the Singapore Scout Association (SSA) in 2023. The ACBP sets
out to educate young Singaporeans on the pitfalls of corruption with an
emphasis on the values of incorruptibility, honesty, and integrity through
a series of interactive activities, games, and discussions. This includes
a specially developed ‘<em>Crack the Case</em>’ activity where students
take on the role of Corrupt Practices Investigation Officers to find elements
of corruption and evidence of bribery to solve a mock case. A key component
of the ACBP requires students to share their key learning points with their
peers and educators, in order to amplify awareness of anti-corruption.
To date, more than 5,000 students from NPCC and SSA have completed the
ACBP.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The corruption situation in Singapore
remains firmly under control. CPIB is grateful for the unwavering support
of a vigilant citizenry who play a vital role to combat corruption. CPIB
remains strongly committed to work closely together with all segments of
the community to keep Singapore corruption-free and ensure that the important
value of incorruptibility continues to be instilled into the young and
future generations of Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

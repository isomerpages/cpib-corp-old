Law enforcement officers ensure that people obey laws and not obstruct the course of justice, the consequence of which can be dire.

3\.        Hui faces two counts of intentionally obstructing the course of justice, an offence punishable under Section 204A of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 and three counts of unauthorised communication of information, an offence under Section 5(1)(e)(i) of the Official Secrets Act, Chapter 213, which is punishable under Section S17(2) of the said Act. The charges alleged that Hui had alerted Lim of Club Icon and an employee of Club De Colour 1, of an impending Police raid. Hui had also allegedly communicated information to three individuals when he was not authorised to do so.

4\.        Lim will be charged with one count of intentionally obstructing the course of justice by using a signal to alert the employees of Club Icon to escape arrest by the police, an offence punishable under Section 204A of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

5\.        Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards any form of criminal activity, and law enforcement officers are expected to uphold high standards of discipline and integrity.

False allegations of corruption against public officers unfairly undermine their integrity and can erode public trust in the public service. Perpetrators of such wrongful acts must be taken to task.

2\.          On 27 June 2019, Harry Ristanto, a 42-year-old Indonesian, was sentenced to three weeks' imprisonment for knowingly cause to give false information relating to a corruption offence.

3\.          Investigations by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) revealed that Ristanto worked as a tour guide. On 6 October 2012, a group of Indonesian tourists led by Ristanto and a Malaysian tour guide entered Singapore via the Tuas Checkpoint. While going through the immigration checkpoint, Ristanto and the Malaysian tour guide were brought to an interview room by a Senior Station Inspector for a brief interview. After the interview, Ristanto informed the Malaysian tour guide that the Senior Station Inspector had asked him for a bribe which he duly paid. 

4\.          Subsequently, Ristanto even signed on a letter alleging that the Senior Station Inspector had asked for a $2,000 bribe and that he had handed over $1,500 to the inspector. This was done despite Ristanto being fully aware that this allegation was untrue. The matter was reported to the CPIB. For this, Ristanto was charged with knowingly cause to give false information relating to the commission of an offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act, an offence punishable under section 28(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

5\.          Any person convicted of knowingly giving false or misleading information relating to corruption offences can be fined up to $10,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to one year or to both. The CPIB will not hesitate to take firm enforcement action against any persons involved in such acts.

On 28 June 2018, Getax Ocean Trades Pte Ltd (Getax Ocean), a Singapore incorporated company, was fined $80,000 for corruption.

2\.        Getax Ocean had earlier been charged on 28 July 2016 with one count of corruptly giving USD$19,918.11 to one Ryke Solomon, a Member of Parliament of the Republic of Nauru, as an inducement to advance the business interests of Getax Australia Pty Ltd (Getax Australia) with the Republic of Nauru. This constituted an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241).

3\.         Getax Ocean acts as the logistics arm of Getax Australia, chartering and arranging vessels for Getax Australia’s phosphate shipments. Getax Australia’s core business at that time was the export of phosphates from Togo and Nauru, and the import of the same to India.  Investigations by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) revealed that on 18 February 2010, a Director at Getax Australia had directed a manager at Getax Ocean to transfer USD$20,000 from a Citibank account to the personal bank account of one Ryke Solomon, of which USD$81.89 was deducted as bank charges. The Citibank account belonged to an agent of Getax Ocean.

4\.         Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The CPIB takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

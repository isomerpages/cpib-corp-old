On 23 September 2022, two individuals were charged in Court for alleged corruption. They were:

a) Abdul Rahim Bin Mawasi (“Rahim”), a 55-year-old male Singaporean and former Mosque Executive Chairman of the Mosque Management Boards of Darul Aman Mosque (“DAM”) and Sallim Mattar Mosque (“SMM”); and
 
b) Mohd Mustaqim Kam @ Kam Hock Beng (“Mustaqim”), a 64-year-old male Singaporean and director of Zeal-Con Engineering Pte Ltd (“Zeal-Con”) at the material time.
 
2\. Sometime in 2019, Rahim allegedly corruptly obtained gratification in the form of shares of Amal Travel & Tour Pte Ltd from Mustaqim, as a reward for providing advice to Mustaqim regarding the price of Zeal-Con’s quotes to DAM and SMM for works to be carried out at both mosques. Rahim and Mustaqim will each face a charge for an offence punishable under Sections 6(a) and 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act respectively.

3\. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1960 can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both.

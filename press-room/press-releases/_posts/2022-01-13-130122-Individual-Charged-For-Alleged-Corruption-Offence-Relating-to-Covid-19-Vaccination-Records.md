On 13 January 2022, Tan Li Ming Kelvin (“Tan”) (陳立明), a 34-year-old male Singaporean, will be charged in court for alleged corruption offence relating to Covid-19
vaccination records.

2\. On 26 October 2021, Tan had allegedly offered a S$50 bribe to a part-time vaccination nurse at Healthway Vaccination Centre at Chua Chu Kang Community Club, Singapore. The bribe was allegedly intended as an inducement for the nurse to record in a
healthcare system that he had been administered his second Pfizer-BioNTech/COMIRNATY Covid-19 vaccination dose when this was not the case. The nurse rejected the bribe offer. For his actions, Tan faces a charge for an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

3\. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both. 

4\. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau looks into all corruption related complaints and reports, including anonymous ones, and can be reached via the following channels:

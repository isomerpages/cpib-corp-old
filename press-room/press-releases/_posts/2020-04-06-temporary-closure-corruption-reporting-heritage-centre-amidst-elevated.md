The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will be implementing an elevated set of safe distancing measures, as a circuit breaker to pre-empt the trend of increasing local transmission of COVID-19. The measures will take effect between 7 April to 4 May (inclusive) 2020.

2\.        In line with these measures, the CPIBâ€™s Corruption Reporting & Heritage Centre (CRHC) @ 247 Whitley Road will be temporarily closed from 7 April to 4 May (inclusive) 2020. The CPIB will still operate as usual. However, members of the public are strongly advised against visiting the CPIB headquarters during this time of elevated safe distancing measures. The following modes of lodging corruption reports with the Bureau are instead recommended:

a) Call the Duty Officer at 1800-376-0000;<br />
b) Lodge an [e-Complaint](/e-services/e-complaint-for-corrupt-conduct);<br>
c) Email us at <a class="spamspan" href="mailto:report@cpib.gov.sg">report@cpib.gov.sg</a>; or<br />
d) Write to us at the CPIB Headquarters @ 2 Lengkok Bahru, S159047.

3\.        Where possible, the report should include the following information:

a) Where, when and how the alleged corrupt act happened?<br />
b) Who was involved and what were their roles?<br />
c) What was the bribe given and the favour shown?

**Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau**

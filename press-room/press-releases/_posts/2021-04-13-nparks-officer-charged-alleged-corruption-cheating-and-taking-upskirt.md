On 13 April 2021, Lee Choon Phing (李俊平, a 48-year-old male Singapore Citizen) (“Lee”), a Manager of the Community in Bloom Branch of National Parks Board (“NParks”) was charged in court for allegedly committing offences relating to corruption, cheating and insulting the modesty of women, as follows:

a) In February 2020, Lee corruptly attempted to obtain S$10,000 from one Tan Beng Khoon (“Tan”), the sole proprietor of SBM Easi Trade (“SBM”), as a reward for misrepresenting to NParks that SBM had fulfilled an order to deliver 10,000 hats by a stipulated deadline when in reality, the delivery was late and had a shortfall of 5,000 hats. Lee’s misrepresentation had resulted in SBM avoiding any late delivery fee and eventually led NParks to pay the full contract amount to SBM. For such actions, Lee faces one charge for an offence punishable under Section 6(a) read with Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

b) In connection with his alleged corruption offence, Lee had cheated an Accounts Executive from NPark’s Finance Branch by deceiving him into believing that SBM had delivered the full order to NParks by the stipulated deadline, inducing the latter to deliver the full contractual payment of S$23,300 to SBM. For such actions, Lee faces one charge for an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

c) Separately, Lee was also found to have intruded upon the privacy of various women with the intention to insult their modesty by using his mobile phone to capture upskirt photographs of them. He allegedly committed such acts between 2015 and 2019. For such actions, Lee faces 9 charges for offences punishable under Section 509 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

2\.        Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption and other crimes. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both. The maximum imprisonment term for each offence of corruption can be increased to 7 years if it is in relation to a matter or contract with the Government or public body, or a subcontract to execute work comprised in such contract. Any person who is convicted of cheating under Section 420 of the Penal Code can be sentenced to imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and also be liable to a fine. Any person who is convicted of intruding upon the privacy of a woman with the intention to insult her modesty under Section 509 of the Penal Code can be sentenced to imprisonment for a term which may extend to a year, or shall be liable to a fine, or both.

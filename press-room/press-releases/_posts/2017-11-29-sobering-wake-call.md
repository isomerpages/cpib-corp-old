On 29 November 2017, one Tock Chan Kok, a 46 year-old delivery driver, was sentenced to three weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $2,100 for attempting to bribe two police officers and for offences under the Road Traffic Act.

2\.          Tock was first charged on 2 March 2017 with one count of corruptly offering gratification of S$50 to two police officers, Sergeant Muhammad Sufi Bin Mohd Hussin and Sergeant Sally Chua Wei Ting, to refrain from taking enforcement action against him for drink-driving, an offence punishable under section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.          Investigations had revealed that on 9 October 2016, the two police officers had spotted Tock sitting in the driver’s seat of his van in the vicinity of Senja Road. When asked to produce his driving licence and identity card, Tock took out a $50 note instead and extended it towards the police officers. The money was rejected by the police officers and the matter was reported to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau.

4\.          Tock was also charged in Court on 2 March 2017 with drink-driving and leaving vehicle in a manner causing obstruction, offences under Section 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act (Chapter 276, Rev Ed 2004) and Section 122 of the Road Traffic Act (Chapter 276) respectively. He has also been disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 15 months with effect from date of release.

5\.         In Singapore, it is an offence to bribe or attempt to bribe public officers. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both.

6\.          Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption and other criminal acts. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

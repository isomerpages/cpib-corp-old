The clanking of slot machines, the shuffling sounds of poker cards or the jubilant shouts of the lucky winners are all too familiar when we step into a casino. Gambling to many is a game of luck and chance, and we all hope for the best odds to win. But when manipulation takes place, the game’s outcome is thwarted. Read on to find out what happens when bribery happens in the casino…

2\.         The accused, Lim Khan Lerk Kenneth (Kenneth), will be charged in court on 5 September 2012 for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

3\.         Kenneth was a dealer at the Marina Bay Sands Singapore casino at the time of the offences. His job was to assist in the operation and flow of the game at the casino gambling table that he was assigned to.

4\.         On 7 October 2010, Kenneth was assigned to perform dealer duty at a Money Wheel table. The pit supervisor then was Yong Kee-Hwei Keith (Keith). Keith had arrived at the table assigned to Kenneth together with a patron, Tan Tiong Loon @ Steven (Steven).

5\.         Investigations revealed that, Steven and Keith had colluded to cheat the casino, where Keith would stop the Money Wheel at the outcome which Steven had placed his bet on. But when Keith suspected that Kenneth knew about the collusion, he offered Kenneth $1,000 cash. Kenneth accepted the offer. As a result, Steven won $13,500 in the game where Keith used his hand to stop the Money Wheel at the 45-times outcome which Steven placed his bet on. Kenneth then asked for an additional $2,000 from Keith.

6\.         Subsequently, Steven won $18,000 in another game where Kenneth spun the wheel and Keith likewise used his hand to stop the wheel at the 45-times outcome. Kenneth later demanded another $7,000 from Keith.

7\.         Kenneth will be charged for one count of agreeing to accept gratification, and two counts of corruptly attempting to obtain gratification, which is an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

8\.         The respective charges are attached for reference.

9\.         Singapore has always adopted a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) takes a serious view of any corrupt practices in Singapore and will not hesitate to take action against any parties involved in corrupt practices.

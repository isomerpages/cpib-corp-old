Individuals suspected of offences such as drink driving should never try to bribe their way out of law enforcement checks by authorities. Those who attempt to do so will face more serious consequences under the law.

2      On 12 June 2020, Han Shaolu (“Han”), 韩绍录, a 36-year-old PRC national, was charged with three counts of corruptly offering $100 to three police officers, Senior Staff Sergeant Roslan bin Abdul Rasip, Sergeant Muhammad Shakir Lim bin Muhammad Sharizal Lim, and Assistant Superintendent Tan Jia Ming, as an inducement to refrain from arresting Han. These constituted offences punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. The offences were committed on 3 December 2019, and the police officers did not accept Han’s offer.

3      Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to bribe or attempt to  bribe another individual or entity. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

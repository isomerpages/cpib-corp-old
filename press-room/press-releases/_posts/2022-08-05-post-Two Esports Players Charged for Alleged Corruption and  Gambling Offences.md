On 5 August 2022, two individuals involved in professional e-sports will be charged in Court for alleged corruption and gambling offences. They are: 

i) **Tan Shern Ryan (“Tan”)**(20-year-old male Singaporean); and 

ii) **Chung Wai Kiat Malcolm (“Chung”)** (曾伟杰, 24-year-old male Singaporean). 

2\. On 22 September 2020, Tan allegedly promised gratification to Chung as an inducement to fix the outcome of an e-sports match played between two teams, i.e., Resurgence and Blackbird Ignis. The teams had competed in Valorant in the EPULZE Royal SEA Cup tournament. In addition, the gratification was allegedly in the form of partial winnings from bets placed through an illegal online gambling site on the aforementioned match. For their actions, Tan and Chung face one count each for an offence punishable under Sections 5(b)(i) and 5(a)(i), respectively, of the Prevention of Corruption Act. In addition, Tan faces one count for an offence punishable under Section 8(1) of the Remote Gambling Act 2014 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code, and Chung faces one count for an offence punishable under Section 8(1) of the Remote Gambling Act 2014. 

3\. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) will not hesitate to take stern action against any parties involved if evidence of match-fixing through bribery is established. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or both. Any person who is convicted of unlawful gambling can be fined up to S$5,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to six months or both. 

4\. CPIB looks into all corruption-related complaints and reports, **including anonymous ones**, and can be reached via the following channels:

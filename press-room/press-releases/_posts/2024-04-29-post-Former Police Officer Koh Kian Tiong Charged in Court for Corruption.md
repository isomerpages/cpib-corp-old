<p>On 29 April 2024, former police officer Koh Kian Tiong (“Koh”) (许建忠, 51-year-old
male Singaporean) was charged in Court with corruption offences involving
the obtaining or accepting of bribes from one Chua Chin Hoe (“Chua”), a
former syndicate head who operated a chain of illegal gambling houses.
At the material time, Koh was an Assistant Superintendent of Police, attached
to the Criminal Investigation Department. Koh was overseas and did not
return when CPIB conducted investigation in 2007. He was repatriated to
Singapore on 28 April 2024 after having served a jail sentence for separate
criminal offences committed in the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Over several occasions between 2006 and 2007, Koh allegedly obtained
a total of S$47,700 in bribes from Chua. In the same period, Koh also accepted
an unspecified sum in the form of alcohol and entertainment from Chua.
These gratifications were allegedly obtained or accepted as inducements
for showing favour to Chua in police-related matters. For his alleged actions,
Koh faced 14 charges for offences punishable under Section 6(a) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Chua had been sentenced in 2012 to four-and-a-half years’ jail
and fined S$20,000 for offences under the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act </em>and
the <em>Common Gaming House Act</em>. Three other police officers in connection
with Koh’s alleged offences had also been charged and sentenced in 2010
for offences under the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of
the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act,</em> can be fined up to S$100,000 or
sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both.</p>
<p></p>

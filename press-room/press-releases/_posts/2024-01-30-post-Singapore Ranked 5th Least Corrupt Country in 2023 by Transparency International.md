<p>The 2023 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index (TI-CPI)
has ranked Singapore the 5th least corrupt country in the world out of
180 countries with a score of 83. Singapore maintained the same rank and
score from the 2022 TI-CPI, and remained the only Asian country ranked
in the top 10.</p>
<p>2. The TI-CPI ranks and measures countries by their perceived levels of
public sector corruption. The 2023 index draws upon the views of experts
and surveys of business people, and is calculated using data from 13 external
sources. Countries are then scored on a scale of zero, for highly corrupt,
to 100, for very clean. TI’s 2023 report urged countries to strengthen
justice and the effective rule of law, as these are essential for preventing
and stopping corruption.</p>
<p>3. The corruption situation in Singapore remains firmly under control.
In the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index 2023, Singapore was ranked
3rd for absence of corruption, the top Asian nation out of 142 countries.
The Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) ranked Singapore as
the least corrupt country in its 2023 Report on Corruption in Asia out
of 16 economies, a position we have held since 1995. Domestically, the
number of public sector corruption cases remains consistently low and Public
Perception Surveys regularly conducted by CPIB indicate strong public confidence
in our national corruption control efforts.</p>
<p>4. Singapore’s reputation as one of the least corrupt countries in the
world is hard-earned. CPIB will continue to work with the community to
keep corruption at bay. CPIB is grateful to all members of the public for
their constant vigilance and strong support in the fight against corruption,
especially those who have come forward to report wrongdoing. CPIB takes
a serious view of all reports and information that may disclose a corruption
offence, whether the informant is known or anonymous. Together, we will
continue to ensure that incorruptibility remains a key part of the Singaporean
DNA.</p>

There is no limit on the bribe amount that the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) can and will investigate, even if the amount is as small as one dollar. A bribe of one dollar is still an offence. 

2\.          On 10 January 2019, a forklift operator employed by Cogent Container Depot Pte Ltd (“Cogent”) was jailed for corruption. Chen Ziliang (陈子良), a 47-year-old male, was sentenced to 2 months’ imprisonment and ordered to pay a penalty of $4,870.50, for embarking on a course of conduct to obtain bribes from truck drivers at Cogent.

3\.          Chen was responsible for operating forklifts for the loading or unloading of containers for truck drivers. Investigations by the CPIB revealed that in October 2017, a truck driver had confronted Chen after having to wait for a considerably long time in the queue. Chen then informed the driver that it was the norm for truck drivers to pay one dollar, or risk having to wait longer in the queue or be given containers that were in a bad condition. 

4\.          In March 2018, when Chen was arrested by the CPIB, coins amounting to $2 were found on the mudguard of the forklift operated by Chen. 

5\.          Subsequent investigations revealed that Chen had in the course of his employment with Cogent, had obtained bribes of $7 to $10 daily from truck drivers so as not to delay the collection or return of containers from or onto the vehicles of these truck drivers.  Chen embarked on this corrupt practice from 1 February 2016 up to 12 March 2018 and it was estimated he had obtained approximately $4,872.50 in bribes. As a result, he was charged with the practice of corruptly obtaining gratifications from truck drivers at Cogent, as an inducement to not delay the collection or return of containers onto the vehicles of these truck drivers, an offence punishable under section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241, which is an amalgamated charge pursuant to section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapter 68. 

6\.    Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to obtain bribes, or attempt to obtain bribes from another individual or entity. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

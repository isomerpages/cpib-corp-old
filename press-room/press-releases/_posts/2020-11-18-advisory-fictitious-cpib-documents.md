The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) is aware that some members of the public have recently received documents via WhatsApp purporting to come from CPIB. The documents indicate that certain bank accounts of individuals, companies and third parties will be frozen within 24 hours for investigation into suspected money laundering offences. They will then be asked to pay a fine. The documents feature images of CPIB’s logo and may also feature a sign-off by a CPIB officer. The CPIB has reviewed the documents and found them to be fictitious in nature. Some tell-tale signs in the documents include spelling and grammatical errors.

2\.       Members of the public are advised to take the following precautions if they receive messages containing purported CPIB documents which may be dubious in nature:

* Call the CPIB’s hotline at 1800-376-0000 for assistance to verify the authenticity of the documents.
* Do not remit or transfer any money for any transactions based on instructions which may be included with or in such documents.
* Refrain from providing personal information and bank details to the sender


3\.       The CPIB takes a serious view of the impersonation of public agencies for undesirable or scam purposes. If you have any information on suspected scams based on the impersonation of the CPIB or its officers, please call the CPIB hotline at 1800-376-0000.

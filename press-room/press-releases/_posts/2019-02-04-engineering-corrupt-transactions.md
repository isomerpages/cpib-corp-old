Companies and their employees operating in Singapore are expected to conduct business dealings in a fair and transparent manner, instead of turning to corrupt practices. 

2\.        On 4 February 2019, two Korean engineers employed by Dongah Geological Engineering Co Ltd, Singapore Branch (“Dongah”) were charged in Court for corruption. 

3\.         Lee Dongchul, a 38-year-old civil engineer, was charged with one count of corruptly accepting gratification of $3,000 from Sim Cher Kwang and Andy Sia Chee Shang of Fasten Hardware and Engineering Pte Ltd (“Fasten”) as an inducement for furthering the business interests of Fasten with Dongah. This constitutes an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

4\.         Lee Myungjae, a 31-year-old planning engineer, was charged with two counts of corruptly obtaining gratification amounting to $4,000 from Sim Cher Kwang of Fasten and Lee Cheng Wee of Taka Hardware and Engineering (S) Pte Ltd (“Taka”) as an inducement for furthering the business interests of Fasten and Taka with Dongah. These constitute offences punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

5\.         Sim Cher Kwang, Andy Sia Chee Shang and Lee Cheng Wee have been charged on 7 November 2018 with corruption and related offences. Their cases are before the Court. 

6\.         Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to accept or obtain bribes from another individual or entity. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

On 13 February 2019, one Tang Joo Yong @ Peter Tang (“Peter Tang”) was sentenced to 14 months' and 10 weeks' imprisonment and a fine of $1,300 for corruption, using criminal force against a public servant and other traffic offences. He has also been disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for life with effect from 13 February 2019.

2\.           Peter Tang, a 73-year old male Singaporean, had pleaded guilty to a charge of corruptly offering gratification of $100 to a police officer as an inducement to refrain from taking enforcement action against him and a charge of using criminal force against a public servant. Tang also admitted to driving whilst under disqualification, using a vehicle without insurance coverage, speeding and permitting driving without a licence. 

3\.           Investigations had revealed that on 16 October 2017, Tang had permitted one Manoharan Sivanatham to drive a vehicle owned by him without a valid driving license. This is an offence under Section 35(2) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276 read with Section 35(3) of the same Act.

4\.           In a separate incident that occurred on 10 April 2018, Tang was stopped by Traffic Police Sergeant David Yap (“Sgt Yap”) for speeding. It was then found that Tang was not a holder of a qualified class 3 driving licence and was driving whilst under disqualification. This is not the first occasion Tang has been caught driving whilst under disqualification. For speeding, using a vehicle without insurance coverage, taking and driving away vehicle without the owner’s consent and driving whilst under disqualification, Tang had committed an offence punishable under Section 63(4) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276, Section 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks & Compensation) Act, Chapter 189, Section 96(1) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276 and Section 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act, read with Section 67A(1) of Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276 respectively.

5\.           When Sgt Yap informed Tang he would have to issue Tang a summon for speeding, Tang took out two pieces of $50 notes to offer to Sgt Yap as an inducement to refrain from taking enforcement action against him. The bribe was rejected by Sgt Yap, who then sought Tang’s cooperation to be placed under arrest. Tang walked away and subsequently pushed Sgt Yap on his chest area with both hands. By corruptly offering gratification to Sgt David Yap, Tang had committed an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. For using criminal force against a public servant, Tang had committed an offence punishable under Section 353 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

6\.            Three offences of permitting the use of a motor vehicle without coverage, taking and driving away a vehicle without the owner’s consent and using a vehicle without vehicle insurance was taken into consideration during Tang’s sentencing.

7\.            The CPIB commends Sgt David Yap on his act of integrity and honesty, and encourages members of the public to do the same if they are offered a bribe. They are advised to reach out to the CPIB with information about possible corruption offences via the following channels:

8\. It is an offence to bribe, or attempt to bribe public officers. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both for each charge. The CPIB takes a serious view against such corrupt acts and tough enforcement action will be taken against any persons involved in such offences.

9\.            The Police also take a serious view against persons who obstruct Police officers from carrying out their duties or cause them physical and verbal harm. The Police have zero tolerance towards acts of violence towards Police officers or public servants who are carrying out their duties and will not hesitate to take action against those who blatantly disregard the law.

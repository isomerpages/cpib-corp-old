On 19 October 2021, two individuals were charged in Court for allegedly obtaining and giving gratifications in relation to the trading and supplying of bunker fuel. They are:

a) Muhammad Afzal Bin Mohamed Ekbar (“Afzal”, 34-year-old male Singaporean), bunker trader of KPI Bridge Oil Singapore Pte Ltd (“KPI”) at the material time; and

b) Mohammad Shafiq Bin Nezammuddin (“Shafiq”, 32-year-old male Singaporean), Director of Straits Bunkering Pte Ltd (“Straits”) at the material time.

2\. Between June 2017 and August 2018, Afzal had allegedly obtained gratifications totaling at least USD191,250 from Shafiq on multiple occasions as rewards for nominating Straits for the supply of bunker fuel to KPI’s customers. Afzal had also allegedly obtained a gratification in the form of a S$90,000 loan from Shafiq as an inducement for the same purpose. For their actions, Afzal and Shafiq will each face three charges for offences punishable under Section 6(a) and Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act respectively, of which two charges are amalgamated under Section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

3\. In addition, between July 2017 and September 2018, Afzal had allegedly given gratifications totaling at least USD161,800 and S$5,000 combined to other individuals on multiple occasions as inducements or rewards for them to place orders with KPI for the supply of bunker fuel. For his actions, Afzal will face nine additional charges for offences punishable under Section 5(b)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, of which four charges are amalgamated under Section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

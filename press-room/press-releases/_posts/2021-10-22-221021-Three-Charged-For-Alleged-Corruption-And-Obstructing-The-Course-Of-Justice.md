On 22 October 2021, Pai Keng Pheng (白敬平, 58-year-old male Singaporean), the former Managing Director of Sentek Marine and Trading Pte Limited (“Sentek”), was charged in court for corruption and obstructing the course of justice. Two other individuals, Pai Guat Mooi (白月梅, 53-year-old female Singaporean) and Wong Wai Seng (王伟成, “Wong”, 50-year-old male Singaporean) were also charged for corruption in connection with these alleged offences. Both Pai Keng Pheng and Pai Guat Mooi were earlier charged in court for their alleged involvement in a conspiracy to dishonestly receive marine gas oil (MGO) stolen from Shell Pulau Bukom.

2\. Between 2018 and 2021, Pai Keng Pheng had allegedly arranged for three bunker clerks to leave and remain away from Singapore, intending to make them unavailable for police investigations into the suspected involvement of Sentek and others in the receipt of MGO misappropriated from Shell Pulau Bukom. During this period, Pai Keng Pheng had allegedly given the three bunker clerks or their representatives around S$839,540 with the assistance of Pai Guat Mooi, Wong and others, as an inducement for the three bunker clerks to remain outside Singapore to avoid the said Police investigations.

3\. In January 2018, Pai Keng Pheng had also allegedly instructed Wong to tell the three bunker clerks to dispose of their handphones, which Pai Keng Pheng knew were likely to contain evidence relevant to the said Police investigations. Further, in November 2018, Pai Keng Pheng had allegedly instructed Wong to lie to the Police that the three bunker clerks were out at sea and uncontactable, intending to conceal their true location from the Police to obstruct investigations into the case. 

4\. Accordingly, Pai Keng Pheng faced:

a) 30 charges for offences under Section 5(b)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act for giving gratification; and

b) 10 charges for offences punishable under Sections 204A and 204A(b) of the Penal Code for obstructing the course of justice.

5\. For abetting the corruption offences, Pai Guat Mooi and Wong faced nine charges and three charges respectively for offences under Section 5(b)(i) read with Section 29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

6\. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both. Any person who is convicted under Section 204A of the Penal Code can be fined or sentenced to imprisonment of up to seven years or to both.

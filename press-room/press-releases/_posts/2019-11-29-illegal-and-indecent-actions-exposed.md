Law enforcement officers have the duty to maintain law and order, and conduct themselves with integrity and discipline. Those who abuse their position to obtain or solicit any form of gratification in the course of their duties must bear the full brunt of the law. 

2\.         On 29 November 2019, Mahendran S/O Selvarajoo, a 31-year old male Singaporean Staff Sergeant of the Singapore Police Force (SPF), will be charged with the following: 

a)    Two counts of corruptly obtaining sexual gratification from two female subjects of investigations by the SPF, which are offences under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. The gratifications were obtained as inducement to help one subject avoid criminal prosecution, and the other with her employer’s purported queries regarding the investigations against her.

b)    One count of accessing without authority the photo gallery in a female subject’s mobile phone to photograph three of her personal photos. This constitutes an offence punishable under Section 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act, Chapter 50A. 

c)    Two counts of modifying without authority the contents of a computer by copying out videos and folders from the laptops of two female subjects to his own portable storage devices. These constitute offences punishable under Section 5(1) of the Computer Misuse Act, Chapter 50A.

d)    Two counts of having in his possession (in his mobile phone and USB flash drive) a total of 46 videos and 26 photos with obscene objects, which are offences punishable under Section 292(1)(a) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

3\.          The case was referred to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau by the SPF. 

4\.         Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. The CPIB will not hesitate to take firm action against all corrupt offenders, including public officers who abuse their position of authority to cause undue harm to the public and tarnish the image of the public service. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

5\.         The CPIB looks into all corruption complaints and reports, including anonymous ones, and can be reached via the following channels:

a) Visit or write to us at the CPIB Headquarters @ 2 Lengkok Bahru, S159047 or Corruption Reporting & Heritage Centre @ 247 Whitley Road S297830;<br />

6\.          Where possible, the report should include the following information:

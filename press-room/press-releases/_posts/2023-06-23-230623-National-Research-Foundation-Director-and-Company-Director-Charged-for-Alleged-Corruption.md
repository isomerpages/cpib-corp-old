b) Lee Tze Boon (“Lee”) (李志文, 50-year-old male, Singaporean), Director of Smart Illumination Pte Ltd (“SI”) at the material time.

2\. Between May and August 2021, Wong had allegedly agreed to accept gratification in the form of 30% shareholding in SI from Lee as a reward for advancing SI’s business interest in its application for grant funding from BETA.

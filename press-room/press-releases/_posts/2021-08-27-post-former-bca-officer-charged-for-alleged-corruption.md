On 27 August 2021, Tan Ming Lie (陈明烈, a 32-year-old male Singapore Citizen)(“Tan”), a Temporary Inspection Officer of the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”) at the material time, was charged in Court for alleged corruption. 

	
2\.         On 25 November 2020, Tan allegedly obtained gratification from a General Manager of Domain Trading & Construction Pte Ltd (“Domain Trading”), which was managing a construction site located at 69 Begonia Drive. The alleged gratification was in the form of a $600 payment for the provision of consultancy services from Angelshield Safety Consultant Pte Ltd (“Angelshield”) to Domain Trading, and was purportedly an inducement for Tan to not show disfavour in a BCA inspection conducted at 69 Begonia Drive.

3\.         On 26 November 2020, Tan allegedly attempted to obtain gratification from a Project Manager of Sin Hock Keong Construction Pte Ltd (“Sin Hock Keong”), which was managing a construction site located at 4 Plantation Avenue. The alleged gratification was similarly in the form of provision of consultancy services from Angelshield to Sin Hock Keong, and was purportedly an inducement for Tan to not show disfavour in a BCA inspection conducted at 4 Plantation Avenue. The incident was reported to the BCA and the case was subsequently referred to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).

4\.         Tan will face two charges punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

5\.         Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.

The giving, offering or accepting of bribes with corrupt intent is illegal. Employees found guilty of corruption in their conduct of business have to face the full consequences under the law.

* 9 counts of corruptly giving gratification, amounting to at least $10,900, to 3 Service Advisors of Kah Motor Co. Sdn. Bhd.

3\.      Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to an imprisonment term of up to 5 years or both. 

4\.      Companies are strongly advised to put in place robust procedures in areas such as internal audit to reduce the incidence of corruption. Guidance for companies on measures to adopt to prevent corruption can be found in PACT: A Practical Anti-Corruption Guide for Businesses in Singapore, which is available on CPIB’s website. Companies are also strongly encouraged to obtain certification under the Singapore Standard (SS) ISO 37001 – Anti-Bribery Management Systems, which is designed to help companies implement an anti-bribery management system or enhance existing systems to reduce corporate risks and reputational costs associated with corruption.

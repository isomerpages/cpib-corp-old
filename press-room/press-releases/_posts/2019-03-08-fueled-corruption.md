The bunkering industry in Singapore is among the largest in the world. It is important to protect the integrity of the industry and to ensure a level playing field for all. 

2\.          On 8 March 2019, a 35-year-old Chinese Singaporean, Lim Leong (林良), was charged in court for corruption. Lim Leong, a bunker clerk, was charged with one count of corruptly offering gratification of an unspecified sum to Keshminder Singh, a Marine Surveyor in the employment of Viking Marine Services Pte Ltd, as an inducement for certifying that a certain quantity of bunker fuel was supplied to vessel A70 when in fact a lesser quantity of bunker fuel was supplied. This constitutes an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. Keshminder Singh did not accept his offer.  

3\.          Singapore does not tolerate corruption. It is a serious offence to give or attempt to give bribes. Any person who is convicted of corruption can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

The Transparency International (TI) Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) 2019 has ranked Singapore the 4th least corrupt country in the world out of 180 countries with a score of 85, a high score from the preceding TI-CPI 2018 which Singapore has successfully maintained. Singapore is again the only Asian country ranked in the top 10.

2\.    The TI-CPI ranks and measures countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption. The 2019 index draws upon 13 expert assessments and surveys of business people. Countries are then scored on a scale of zero, for highly corrupt, to 100, for very clean. 

3\.    The corruption situation in Singapore remains firmly under control. Annual corruption statistics released by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) also indicates that the number of public sector corruption cases has remained low over the years. Singapore is well-regarded internationally for our anti-corruption efforts. Besides our consistently good showing under the TI-CPI, the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) ranked Singapore as the least corrupt country in its 2019 Report on Corruption in Asia, a position we have held since 1995. In the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index 2019, Singapore was also ranked 3rd for absence of corruption, the top Asian nation out of 126 countries ranked. While we are heartened by such affirmation under credible international indices, we must not rest on our laurels.   

4\.    “The Singapore Public Service continues to be well-regarded as one which is clean and efficient. CPIB Statistics show that we have a consistently low number of public sector corruption cases. While Singapore has done relatively well in the fight against corruption as attested by several international surveys, we must not allow this to lull us into a sense of complacency. In fact, we must work even harder to ensure that incorruptibility remains part of the DNA of every Singaporean. Together with the community and all stakeholders, the CPIB remains committed to combat corruption with strong resolve to ensure that the corruption situation in Singapore remains firmly under control.” said Mr Denis Tang, Director CPIB.

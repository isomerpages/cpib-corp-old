Using underhanded methods to deceive your employer in order to cover up your ill-gotten gains will eventually land you in hot water.

2\.          On 22 July 2016, Mohamed Sa’ad Bin Mohamed Ali will be charged with 718 counts of cheating, an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224), and 9 counts of money laundering, an offence under Section 47(1)(c), and punishable under Section 47(6)(a) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A).

3\.          The charges alleged that Sa’ad, a technical officer with the Public Utilities Board (PUB), attached to Choa Chu Kang Waterworks, had cheated multiple employees at the PUB into believing that he had genuinely sourced for quotations from the open market. As a result, he had dishonestly induced the employees to approve the sourced quotations for various purchase orders which they would not have done had they not been so deceived. The purchase orders, which had a total worth of $1,981,175, were subsequently awarded to businesses controlled by Sa’ad.

4\.          Sa’ad had also allegedly used the benefits gained from these purchase orders to acquire a vehicle, an insurance policy, a Gold Certificate, a factory unit, and to repay his mortgage loans.

5\.          Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards any criminal activity. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and criminal conduct, and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

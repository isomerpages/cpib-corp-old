Attempts to bribe law enforcement officers will be firmly dealt with by the law.

2\.          On 3 August 2016, Zhu Kuai will be charged with one count of corruptly offering to Assistant Superintendent of Police Chan Wai Hoong, a gratification of $10,000 as an inducement to cease conducting investigations for her involvement in possible offences, an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. 

3\.          The offer was rejected by the Police Officer and the matter was reported to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).

4\.          In Singapore, it is an offence to bribe, or attempt to bribe, public officers. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both.

5\.          Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau takes a serious view of any corrupt practices, and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

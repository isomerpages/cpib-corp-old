2\.       On 23 September 2015, one Soh Yew Meng, formerly a Director in the employment of Resorts World at Sentosa Pte Ltd, and one Tan Siow Hui, a freelance quantity surveyor will be charged in Court for corruption offences.

3\.       Soh Yew Meng faces 4 counts of corruptly obtaining gratification and 3 counts of corruptly attempting to obtain gratification, amounting to at least $317,000.

4\.

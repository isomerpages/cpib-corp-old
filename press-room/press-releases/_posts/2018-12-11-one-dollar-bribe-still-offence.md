Employees are expected to carry out their duties fairly instead of obtaining bribes in exchange for favours. Even if the bribe amount is as low as $1, they can be taken to task. Bribes of any amount or any kind will not be tolerated.

2\.       On 11 December 2018, two forklift truck operators employed by Cogent Container Depot Pte Ltd (“Cogent”) were each charged with embarking on a course of conduct to obtain small value bribes from truck drivers at Cogent.

3\.       Chen Ziliang (陈子良), a 47-year-old male, was charged with one count of corruptly attempting to obtain from one Jiang Xingnian, a gratification of $1, as an inducement for not delaying the collection of a container onto Jiang’s vehicle, an offence punishable under section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. In addition, he was also charged with one count of embarking on a course of conduct between May 2016 and March 2018 of corruptly obtaining gratification of similar value from truck drivers at Cogent, as inducement for not delaying the collection or return of containers onto the vehicles of these truck drivers. This constituted an offence punishable under section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241, which is an amalgamated charge pursuant to section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapter 68.

4\.       Zhao Yucun (赵玉村), a 43-year-old male, was also charged with one count of embarking on a course of conduct between September 2014 and March 2018 of corruptly obtaining gratification of similar value from truck drivers at Cogent, as inducement for not delaying the collection or return of containers onto the vehicles of these truck drivers. This constituted an offence punishable under section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241, which is an amalgamated charge pursuant to section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapter 68.

5\.       Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to bribe, or attempt to bribe another individual or entity. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

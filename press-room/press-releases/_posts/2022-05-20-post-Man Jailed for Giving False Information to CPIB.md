On 20 May 2022, **Foong Chang Sheng (“Foong”)** (冯长胜, 43-year-old male Singaporean), was convicted and sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment for giving false information, an offence under Section 28 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. At the time of the offence, he was an employee of Grocery Logistics of Singapore Pte Ltd (“GLS”).
 
2\. Foong knowingly gave false information to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) on 10 November 2021. He falsely alleged that one Kelvin Tan Lee Hian (“Kelvin”), a Director of Lian Eng Hardware Pte Ltd (“Lian Eng”), had offered to pay him a commission amounting to 5% of Lian Eng’s quotation price for its proposed Pallet Checker System, in exchange for recommending Lian Eng’s proposal to GLS. As a result of the false information, CPIB conducted extensive investigations to determine if Kelvin and other employees of Lian Eng had engaged in corrupt dealings.

3\. On 14 January 2022, after being confronted with CPIB’s investigative findings, Foong conceded that he had lied about Kelvin’s corrupt offer and had knowingly given false information to CPIB on 10 November 2021.

4\. For his actions, Foong was previously charged in Court on 8 April 2022.

5\. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both. Any person who is convicted of an offence of knowingly giving false information under Section 28 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, can be fined up to S$10,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to one year or to both.

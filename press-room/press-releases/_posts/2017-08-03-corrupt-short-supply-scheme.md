Individuals and organisations must never strike up corrupt bargains to undersupply goods or services in exchange for gratification. Such corrupt agreements can inflate the true cost of doing business in Singapore.

2\.        On 3 August 2017, two Singaporeans will be charged in court for the following offences:

a) Chua Zhong Heng, Sales Manager of Straits Ventura Pte Ltd

i) One count of abetment by engaging in a conspiracy with one Teng Guan Yu, to corruptly offer a sum of $2,500 to one Chaudhary Prince, a Storeman employed by Hydrochem (S) Pte Ltd, as an inducement to accept (on behalf of Hydrochem) a short supply of 500 pieces of plywood from Straits Ventura, an offence punishable under section 6(b) read with section 29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

b) Teng Guan Yu, Sales Manager of Hock Lin Leong Timber Trading Pte Ltd

ii) One count of abetment by engaging in a conspiracy with one Chua Zhong Heng (“Chua”), to corruptly offer a sum of $2,500 to one Chaudhary Prince, a Storeman employed by Hydrochem (S) Pte Ltd, as an inducement to accept (on behalf of Hydrochem) a short supply of 500 pieces of plywood from Straits Ventura, an offence punishable under section 6(b) read with section 29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.         In Singapore, it is an offence to bribe, or attempt to offer a bribe. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both.

4\.         Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

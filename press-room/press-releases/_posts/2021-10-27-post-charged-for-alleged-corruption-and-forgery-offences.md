c)	Abdul Razeez Bin Rasit (“Razeez”) (35-year-old male Singaporean), a shareholder of SCAR Services at the material time.

The Alleged Corruption Offences

2\. Sometime around or between 2017 and 2019, Lee was alleged to have received gratification in the form of loans totalling S$83,000. In addition, Lee allegedly received gratification in the form of a car loan. Correspondingly, Nazarisham and Razeez were alleged to have conspired to corruptly give these gratifications to Lee. The gratifications were allegedly intended to induce Lee to advance the business interests of SCAR Services with CCPS, and for providing allegedly forged Certis Cisco Security Pte Ltd (“CCS”) and Certis Cisco Auxiliary Police Force Pte Ltd (“CCAPF”) documents to Nazarisham. For their actions, they face the following charges:

a)	Lee

i.	Seven charges for offences punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act; and

ii.	Six charges for offences punishable under Section 5(a)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

b)	Nazarisham

i.	Six charges for offences punishable under Section 6(b) read with Section 29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

The Alleged Forgery Offences

3\. Sometime around or in 2019, Lee was alleged to have forged various “Safe Keeping Receipt”, “Standing Order Directive”, and acknowledgement of pledge of assets documents relating to the deposit of gemstones. These alleged forgeries were intended to make believe that CCS and CCAPF had purportedly issued the documents when it was not the case. Lee was also alleged to have conspired with Nazarisham to forge a CCS insurance certification document. Separately, Nazarisham was alleged to have used and presented the false “Safe Keeping Receipt” document as genuine, by submitting it to a Notary Public. For their actions, Lee and Nazarisham face the following charges:

a)	Lee faces nine charges for offences punishable under Sections 465 and 467 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

b)	Nazarisham faces one charge for an offence punishable under Section 467 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 and one charge for an offence punishable under Section 471 read with Section 465 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

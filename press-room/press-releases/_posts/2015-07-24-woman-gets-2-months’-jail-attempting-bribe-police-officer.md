On 23 July 2015, South Korean national Hwang Eunmi was sentenced to 2 months’ jail for attempting to bribe a police officer to release her from police custody. Hwang’s sentence was backdated to 3 July 2015, the date she was first remanded.

2\.        Hwang Eunmi was originally charged in Court on 3 July 2015 for corruptly offering S$1,550 to Senior Staff Sergeant Hafizil Bin Mohamed and other officers as an inducement to release her from police custody, an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. Hwang was arrested for an Immigration offence.

3\.        In Singapore, it is an offence to bribe, or attempt to bribe, public officers. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both.

4\.        Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The CPIB takes a serious view of any corrupt practices, and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

It is an offence for any person to knowingly give false or misleading information relating to the commission of a corruption offence to law enforcement officers.

2\.       On 29 November 2018, Peh Boon Hua (白本华), a 49-year-old male Singaporean and former operation director of HK Civil Engineering Pte Ltd, was charged in Court with one count of knowingly giving false information to a Principal Special Investigator of the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, an offence punishable under Section 28(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.       The charge is in relation to a statement given to the CPIB officer alleging that one Ben Ho had given monies to one Kelvin Low, so that Kelvin Low would allow HK Civil Engineering Pte Ltd to dump mud and soil at a work site at Pulau Punggol Timor.

4\.       Any person convicted of knowingly giving false or misleading information relating to corruption offences can be fined up to $10,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to one year or to both.

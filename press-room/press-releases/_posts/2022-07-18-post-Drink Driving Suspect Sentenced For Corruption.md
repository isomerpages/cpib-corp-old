On 18 July 2022, **Han Shaolu (“Han”)**, 韩绍录, a 38-year-old PRC national, was convicted and sentenced to eight weeks’ imprisonment for corruptly offering bribes to Traffic Police Officers.
 
2\. Investigations revealed that on 3 December 2019, **Senior Staff Sergeant Roslan bin Abdul Rasip (“SSSgt Roslan”)** and **Sergeant Muhammad Shakir Lim bin Muhammad Sharizal Lim (“Sgt Shakir”)** approached suspected drink driver Han for a check while Han was resting in his parked car at an open-space carpark in the Geylang area. At the scene, Han corruptly offered S$100 to SSSgt Roslan and Sgt Shakir, as well as **Assistant Superintendent Tan Jia Ming (“ASP Tan”)** who later arrived at the scene, as an inducement to refrain from arresting him. The three Traffic Police Officers did not accept Han’s offer, and the case was reported to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). Han was previously charged in Court on 12 June 2020 for corruption offences punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

3\.  CPIB would like to commend ASP Tan, SSSgt Roslan and Sgt Shakir for their act of integrity, which exemplifies one of the core values of the Public Service.

4\. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person
who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to
imprisonment of up to five years or both.

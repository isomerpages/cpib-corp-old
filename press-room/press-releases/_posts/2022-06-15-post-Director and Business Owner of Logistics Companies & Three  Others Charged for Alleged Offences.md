On 15 June 2022, Diong Yao (“Diong”) (張燿, 40-year-old male Singaporean), Director of DY Express Pte Ltd (“DY Express”), Director of Singapura Logistics Support Pte Ltd (“SLS”) and Business Owner of S-Log Holdings Pte Ltd (“S-Log Holdings”) at the material time, and three other individuals will be charged in Court for their alleged offences in two separate cases.

*Case 1*

2\. Between 2010 to 2014, Diong had allegedly given gratification totalling at least S$1,000 on several occasions to one Premkumar S/O Jaya Kumar (“Premkumar”) (41- year-old male Singaporean), supervisor of DNATA Singapore Pte Ltd (“DNATA”) and support officer of Changi Airport Group Singapore Pte Ltd (“CAG”) at the material time, as inducements for showing leniency to DY Express in the performance of its contractual obligations under a project of DNATA.

3\. In addition, between 2016 to 2017, Diong had allegedly given gratification totalling S$6,500 to Premkumar as rewards for helping drivers to pass the Airfield Driving Safety Compliance Test (“Practical Test”) and issuing Airside Driving Permits to drivers who did not pass both the requisite Airfield Rules Test and Practical Test. Of which, S$4,500 of the gratification had been given in a conspiracy with one Noordin Bin Abdul Gaffor
(“Noordin”) (47-year-old male Singaporean), supervisor of SLS at the material time. This was allegedly done to allow the drivers to perform the contractual obligations of companies controlled by Diong. To facilitate the issuance of Airside Driving Permits to drivers who did not pass both the requisite tests, Premkumar had allegedly made illegal modifications in CAG’s system where he altered the drivers’ records such that they fulfilled the prerequisites for the Airside Driving Permit.  

4\. For their alleged actions in this case, Diong, Premkumar and Noordin face the following charges:

**a) Diong Yao**<br>
i) 2 charges for offences punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act of which 1 charge is amalgamated under Section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code; and<br>
ii) 9 charges for offences punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act read with Section 29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

ii) One charge for unauthorised modification of computer material punishable under Section 5 of the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act, Chapter 50A and 54 amalgamated charges for offences under Section 5 read with Section 11A of the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act, Chapter 50A. These charges stem from a separate investigation by the Singapore Police Force and the offences occurred between September 2016 and December
2017.

**c) Noordin Bin Abdul Gaffor**<br>
i) 9 charges for offences punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act read with Section 29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

The gratifications totalling about S$39,000 were in the form of return air travel, accommodation at a hotel, deposit payment for a car purchase, a luxury watch and a monetary loan.

6\. For their alleged actions in this case, Diong and Chia face the following charges:

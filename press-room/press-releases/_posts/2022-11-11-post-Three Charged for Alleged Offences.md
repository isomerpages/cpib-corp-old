On 11 November 2022, the following three individuals were charged in Court for allegedly committing corruption, cheating and money laundering offences:

a)    **Harish Singhal** (“**Harish**”) (59-year-old male, Indian), a Construction Manager at MODEC Offshore Productions System (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“MOPS”) at the material time;

b)    **Gopinath Kuppusamy (“Gopinath”)** (52-year-old male, Indian), Chief Engineer at MOPS; and

c)     **Kottaki Srinivas Patnaik (“Patnaik”)** (53-year-old male, Indian) Director of Neptune Ship Management Pte Ltd (“Neptune”) at the material time.

_Alleged Corruption Offences_

2\. Between 2011 and 2016, Harish allegedly conspired with four others to corruptly accept gratifications totaling about US$942,000 and S$165,000 from Patnaik as a reward for advancing the business interest of Neptune with MOPS.

_Alleged Money Laundering Offences_

3\. Between 2012 and 2013, Harish allegedly conspired with Patnaik and three others to disguise about US$313,000 of the benefits from the criminal conduct in the form of 12 fictitious invoices for payments from Staghorn Marine Services Pte Ltd in India and Staghorn Marine Services Incorporated in Dubai to Neptune. 

_Alleged Cheating Offences_

4\. Between 2018 and 2021, Harish allegedly conspired with Gopinath and two others to cheat MOPS when they dishonestly concealed from MOPS that they are entitled to a share of earnings from the payments MOPS made to Staghorn Marine Services Pte Ltd (“Staghorn Singapore”). This was done when approving the invoices issued by Staghorn Singapore to MOPS. As a result, MOPS was deceived into paying approximately a total of US$4,644,000, S$1,332,000 and RMB1,265,000 to Staghorn Singapore.

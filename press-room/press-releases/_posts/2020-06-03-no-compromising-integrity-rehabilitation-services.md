Individuals who take advantage of their position for personal gains through corrupt means not only compromised their integrity but those under their care. This is especially so for individuals working in rehabilitation services who obtain bribes from residents in return for leniency in their supervision, as such acts will compromise the efforts to rehabilitate them.

2\.        Roy Evan S/O Rajoo, a 59-year-old Singaporean male, was a former Operations Staff of Teen Challenge (Singapore) (“TCS”) which is a halfway house that provides rehabilitation for Prisons’ inmates emplaced on community-based programmes. On 3 June 2020, he will be charged with the following:

a) 18 counts of corruptly obtaining gratifications in the form of loans amounting to about $3,000 from 12 residents of TCS, as inducement to show leniency in discharging his supervisory duties. These constituted offences punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. These offences were committed between November 2018 to May 2019.

b) Two counts of corruptly attempting to obtain gratifications in the form of loans amounting to $350 from two residents of TCS, as inducement to show leniency in discharging his supervisory duties. These constituted offences punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. These offences were committed in March and May 2019.

3\.       Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to solicit bribes from individuals. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

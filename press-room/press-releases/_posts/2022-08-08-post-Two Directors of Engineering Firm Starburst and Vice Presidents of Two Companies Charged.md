On 5 August 2022, two Directors of Starburst Engineering Pte Ltd (“Starburst”) and

*Alleged Corruption Offences*

entertainment amounting to about S$9,900 to Tan as an inducement for advancing the
business interest of Starburst with JPW. In addition, sometime in 2012, Tan had allegedly
accepted gratification in the form of expenses relating to a trip to the People’s Republic of
China amounting to about S$4,800 from Yap as an inducement for advancing the business
interest of Starburst with JPW. For his actions, Yap faces one amalgamated charge underSection 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Correspondingly, Tan faces one
 amalgamated charge under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and one
charge under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, read with Section 37 of the same Act.

*Alleged Falsification of Accounts Offences*

3\. Between July 2014 to December 2014, Edward had allegedly instigated an officer
of Starburst to issue falsified subcontracts to G-Cube Engineering Pte Ltd (“G-Cube”) for
works valued at a sum of about S$500,800. In addition, between September 2014 and
August 2015, Yap had allegedly instigated an officer of G-Cube to generate false invoices
from G-Cube to Starburst to seek payment for works valued at a sum of about S$552,200.
For their actions, Edward and Yap each face three and eight charges respectively under
Section 477A read with Section 109 of the Penal Code.

containing a comparative analysis of the tender bids received from tenderers for Home
Team Tactical Centre (“HTTC”) Phase 2A and the Development Planning Committee
budget to Yap, when Gerald was not authorised to do so. Gerald had obtained the
aforementioned information owing to his position in CPG, which held a contract with the
Ministry of Home Affairs involving the construction of the HTTC. For his action, Gerald
faces one charge under section 5(1)(e) read with section 5(1)(i) of the Official Secrets Act.

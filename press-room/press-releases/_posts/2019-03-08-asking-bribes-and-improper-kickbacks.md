Companies should not pay bribes to obtain business or to avoid complications in business dealings. If they encounter requests for bribe payments, they should report the matter to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). 

2\.          On 8 March 2019, Jamaluddin Bin Hassan (“Jamaluddin”), a 59-year-old former Purchaser at Yamato Technologies Pte Ltd (“Yamato”), will be charged with four counts of corruptly obtaining or corruptly attempting to obtain gratifications amounting to $2,000 and $1,400 from a Sales Engineer of Delta-Flo Controls Pte Ltd (“Delta-Flo”) and a Sales and Marketing Executive of Senator International Singapore Pte Ltd (“Senator”) respectively. Jamaluddin had allegedly tried to obtain gratification from Delta-Flo as an inducement for him to recommend Delta-Flo to Yamato for a contract. In Senator’s case, the gratifications were allegedly inducement for Jamaluddin to refrain from creating problems for Senator in relation to a contract awarded by Yamato to Senator. These constitute offences punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Chapter 241).

3\.          Singapore does not tolerate corruption. It is a serious offence to obtain bribes, or attempt to obtain bribes and any person who is convicted of corruption can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

On 26 July 2021, Leow Khoon Chye (“Leow”)(“廖坤财”), a 58-year-old Singaporean man, was convicted and sentenced to 14 weeks’ imprisonment for corruptly offering a bribe to a Traffic Police Officer and various traffic offences. Additionally, Leow was disqualified from driving and holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles for 8 years.

2\.         Investigations revealed that on 8 February 2021, Senior Staff Sergeant Muhammad Firdaus Bin Abdul Rahman (“SSSgt Firdaus”) stopped Leow for a check whilst Leow was driving a motor-van in the Ang Mo Kio area. At the scene, it was discovered that Leow had been disqualified from driving, and holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles since March 2018. Leow offered his services as an electrician at a discounted price to SSSgt Firdaus in return for the latter refraining from taking enforcement action against him for road traffic-related offences. SSSgt Firdaus ignored Leow’s corrupt offer, and placed Leow under arrest.  Leow’s offer of a bribe was reported to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). Investigations subsequently revealed that Leow was a repeat traffic offender, having previously been convicted in 2018 for driving whilst under disqualification. 

3\.         In addition to having been convicted for corruptly offering a bribe to SSSgt Firduas, an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Leow was also convicted and sentenced as a repeat offender for driving whilst under disqualification under Section 43(4)(b) of the Road Traffic Act, and for using a motor vehicle without insurance coverage under Section 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act. 

4\.         CPIB would like to commend SSSgt Firdaus for his act of integrity, which exemplifies one of the core values of the Public Service. Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to offer a bribe or attempt to bribe public officers. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both.  

5\.         CPIB looks into all corruption complaints and reports, including anonymous ones, and can be reached via the following channels:

a) Lodge an [e-Complaint](/e-services/e-complaint-for-corrupt-conduct);<br>
b) Email us at <a class="spamspan" href="mailto:report@cpib.gov.sg">report@cpib.gov.sg</a>;<br />
c) Call the Duty Officer at 1800-376-0000; or<br />
d) Write to us at the CPIB Headquarters @ 2 Lengkok Bahru, S159047.

6\.         Where possible, the report should include the following information:

a) Where, when and how the alleged corrupt act happened? <br>
b) Who were involved and what were their roles? <br>
c) What was the bribe involved and the favour shown? <Br>

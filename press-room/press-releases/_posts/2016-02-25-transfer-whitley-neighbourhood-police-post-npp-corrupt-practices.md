The premises of Whitley Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP), located at 247 Whitley Road, will be transferred to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) to use as its Corruption Reporting Centre. To facilitate the handover process, Whitley NPP will cease operations from 29 February 2016.

2\.        The new CPIB Corruption Reporting Centre is centrally located and near the Stevens MRT station (Downtown Line 2), making it more convenient for the public to walk-in and report suspected corrupt practices. The public can also continue to lodge a report using the following channels:

a. Walk-in to the CPIB headquarters at 2 Lengkok Bahru, Singapore 159047;

b. Call CPIB’s 24-hour hotline at 1800-376-0000; or

c. Lodge an online complaint at www.cpib.gov.sg.

3\.        CPIB’s Heritage Gallery will also be co-located within the Reporting Centre to allow members of public to learn about Singapore’s zero tolerance stance towards corruption. The CPIB Corruption Reporting Centre is expected to be operational in December 2016. More details will be made known at a later date.

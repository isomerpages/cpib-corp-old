The launch of a new Apple product is always eagerly anticipated by millions around the world. With the immense popularity of Apple products, being a supplier to one of the most global and saleable brands can be profitable. There is always high temptation to have a slice of this Apple pie, and some will do whatever it takes to get a share.

4\.         Between November 2006 to June 2009, the two accused persons had allegedly worked together to give bribes to one Paul Shim Devine (Paul Devine), a Global Supply Manager under the employment of Apple Inc. In return, Paul Devine would provide information on Apple Inc’s upcoming projects such as product forecasts and pricing targets so that Jin Li Mould Manufacturing Pte Ltd could secure the contracts. Paul Devine had pleaded guilty in US Federal Court in February 2011 to wire fraud, conspiracy and money laundering.

5\.         Investigations revealed that Jacky Chua had allegedly given a total of US$387,600 to Paul Devine over a course of 2 years in Singapore, Macau, People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the United States of America (USA) to advance Jin Li Mould Manufacturing Pte Ltd’s business interests. 

6\.         Andrew Ang had allegedly abetted these transactions as well as those involving two other Singaporean companies, Fastening Technology Pte Ltd and Lateral Solutions Pte Ltd. Moreover, he had also allegedly received payments totalling US$184,000 from the shareholders of the two companies, for aiding them to secure business contracts from Apple Inc through Paul Devine. He also received US$65,100 from Paul Devine for his assistance in the transactions with Jin Li Mould Manufacturing Pte Ltd, Fastening Technology Pte Ltd and Lateral Solutions Pte Ltd.

7\.         Chua Kim Guan (Jacky Chua) will be charged with 14 counts of corruptly giving gratifications to Paul Shim Devine under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

8\.         Ang Kok Kiat Andrew (Andrew Ang) will be charged with 14 counts of abetting to corruptly give gratifications to Paul Shim Devine under Section 6(b) read with Section 29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241; and 9 counts of corruptly receiving gratifications as reward for assisting in the corrupt transactions with Paul Shim Devine under Section 5(a)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

9\.         Both accused persons will be charged in Court on 19 September 2013. The respective charges are attached.

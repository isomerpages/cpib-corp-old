When individuals engage in a conspiracy to manipulate contracts and engineer a deception for their own gain, they may face corruption charges.

2\.        On 24 June 2016, Kang Leong Chuan will be charged with 6 counts of corruptly giving gratification to one Goh Keng Hwee Henry, an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. Kang is charged with corruptly giving a reward amounting to a sum of at least $43,780 to Goh for assisting Fire-Mech Pte Ltd to secure multiple contracts with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and Changi Airport Group (Singapore) Pte Ltd (CAG).

3\.        Kang will also face another 22 charges under Section 6(c) to be read with Section 29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. These offences are for engaging in a conspiracy with various individuals to deceive or mislead CAAS/CAG into believing that Fire-Mech Pte Ltd had provided the cheapest quote by knowingly providing other quotations to Goh that were not, in fact, genuine quotations.

4\.        Goh, a former Technical Officer with CAAS and former Associate Engineer at CAG, has been sentenced to 15 monthsâ€™ imprisonment for his involvement late last year.

5\.        Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau takes a serious view of any corrupt practices, and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

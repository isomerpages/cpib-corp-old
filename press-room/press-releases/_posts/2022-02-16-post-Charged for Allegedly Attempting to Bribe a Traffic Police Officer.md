On 16 February 2022, **Krishna Rao A/L Narisama Naidoo (“Krishna”)** (34-year-old Indian male Malaysian), was charged in Court for allegedly attempting to bribe a Traffic 
Police officer. 

2\. It is alleged that, on 21 November 2021, at around Pioneer Road, Krishna attempted 
to offer bribes totalling S$55 on two occasions to Sergeant Firhan Bin Abdul Rashed, as an 
inducement to refrain from investigating him for a traffic incident. No bribe offers were
accepted by Sergeant Firhan, and the case was subsequently referred to the Corrupt 
Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). For his actions, Krishna faces two charges 
punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. 

3\. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person 
who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to 
imprisonment of up to five years or both.

4\.        The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) looks into all corruption-related complaints and reports, **including anonymous ones**, and can be reached via the following channels:

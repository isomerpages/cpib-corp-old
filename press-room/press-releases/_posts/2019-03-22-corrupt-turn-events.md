When found flouting traffic rules, motorists should not turn to corruption as a way to get out of trouble with the law. 

2\.          On 22 March 2019, Chia Chan Kong (谢振光), a 66-year-old Singaporean male, was charged with one count of corruptly offering $100 to Sergeant Sheikh Abdul Muzzammil Bin Sheikh Abdul Feisal (“Sgt Sheikh”), a Traffic Police (TP) Officer, an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. The alleged gratification was meant as an inducement for the TP Officer to refrain from registering a report against Chia for making an illegal right turn. The bribe was rejected by Sgt Sheikh. 

3\.          Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to bribe or attempt to bribe public officers. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

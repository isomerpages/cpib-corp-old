The popularity of football and the lucrative business of football betting have made the matches susceptible to illegal practices including match-fixing. These practices must be eliminated to protect the integrity of the sport and to keep the local sports scene clean.

2\.      On 9 April 2015, Thana Segar S Sinnaiah (Thana Segar), a 40-year old male Malaysian national was sentenced to 24 months imprisonment for corruption and immigration offences. Thana Segar had earlier pleaded guilty to the following four proceeded charges:

i) One count of abetment by conspiracy with Selvarajan S/O Letchuman (Selvarajan) to corruptly give a gratification of a sum not more than RM 15,000 to Shokri Bin Nor (Shokri) a referee with the Football Association of Malaysia as a reward to fix the Malaysian Super League match between the Lions XII and Sarawak FA scheduled on 22 May 2012, punishable under section 5(b)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241 read with section 108A and section 116 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

ii) Two counts of abetment by conspiracy with Selvarajan and Shokri to cheat Singapore Pools (Private) Limited under section 420 read with section 116 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

iii) One count of failure to present passport when leaving Singapore punishable under section 5A(3) of the Immigration Act, Chapter 133.

3\.       Four other charges of abetment by conspiracy to cheat Singapore Pools under section 420 read with section 116 of the Penal Code were taken into consideration for the sentencing. The respective charges are attached for reference.

4\.      A former national football player, Thana Segar was first charged on 24 May 2012 for one count of engaging with Shokri in a conspiracy to corruptly agreeing to receive a gratification to fix a Malaysian Super League match between the Lions XII and Sarawak FA. While out on bail, Thana Segar absconded and failed to turn up for the pre-trial conference on 7 August 2012. In August 2014, Thana Segar was apprehended with the assistance of the Malaysian AntiCorruption Commission.

5\.      Singapore has always adopted a zero tolerance approach towards corruption, and match fixing of any form is not condoned in Singapore. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) investigates into match-fixing through bribery cases and will not hesitate to take action against any parties involved if they had given or received bribes to fix a match. The Bureau works closely with the Football Association of Singapore (FAS), the authorities and our counterparts to keep the local soccer scene clean.

On 23 June 2022, Gunalan A/L Kuppusamy (“Gunalan”) (43-year-old male Malaysian), was charged in Court for allegedly bribing a Traffic Police Officer and other traffic offences.

2\. It is alleged that, on 13 February 2022, along Pioneer Road, Gunalan corruptly offered a bribe of S$200 to Sergeant Muhammad Faiz Sufyan (“Sgt Faiz”), as an inducement to refrain from investigating him for a traffic incident. No bribe offer was accepted by Sgt Faiz and the case was subsequently referred to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). For his action, Gunalan faces one charge under Section 6(b) of the *Prevention of Corruption Act*.

3\. In addition to the corruption offence, Gunalan faces one charge for drink driving under Section 67(1)(b) punishable under Section 67(1) read with Section 67(2)(a) of the *Road Traffic Act 1961*, one charge for driving whilst under disqualification under Section 43(4) punishable under Section 43(4)(a) of the *Road Traffic Act 1961*; and one charge for using a vehicle without insurance coverage under Section 3(1) punishable under Section 3(2) and Section 3(3) of the *Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act 1960*. These charges stem from a related investigation by the Singapore Police Force.

4\. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both. 

5\. Any person who is convicted of an offence under Section 67(1) of the *Road Traffic Act 1961* can be fined not less than S$2,000 and not more than S$10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both. Any person who is convicted of an offence under Section 43(4) of the *Road Traffic Act 1961* can be fined up to $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both. Any person who is convicted of an offence under Section 3(1) of the *Motor Vehicle (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act 1960* can be fined up to $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both, and be disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence under the *Road Traffic Act 1961* for a period of 12 months from the date of the conviction.

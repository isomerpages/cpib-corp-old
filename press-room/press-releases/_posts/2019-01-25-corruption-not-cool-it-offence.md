Under the law, it is an offence to bribe another individual. This includes agreeing to give or accept bribes as well as attempting to obtain gratification.

2\.        On 25 January 2019, two individuals were charged with the following:

**a)   Wang Fang Kwee (王芳贵), 53-year-old Singaporean, former Facilities and Fire Safety Manager at The Tanglin Club (TTC)**

i. Six counts of corruptly obtaining or corruptly attempting to obtain gratification amounting to $2,700 from Ng Tiam Kiat (“Ng”) as a reward for advancing the business interests of Coolzone Engineering Pte Ltd (“Coolzone”) with TTC. These constitute offences punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.
ii. One count of corruptly agreeing to accept from Wong Boon Choy, Jeffrey gratification of $500, as a reward for advancing the business interests of SQ 1 Development Pte Ltd with TTC, an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.
iii. Two counts of abetment by conspiring with Ng to cheat TTC by deceiving the Club that Coolzone had performed works there when they had not, an offence under Section 420 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. As a result, TTC was dishonestly induced to pay a sum of $6,473.50 to Coolzone, which TTC would not have done so if they had not been deceived.

**b)   Ng Tiam Kiat (黄添吉), 47-year-old Malaysian, Director of Coolzone Engineering Pte Ltd**

i. Six counts of corruptly giving or agreeing to give gratification amounting to S$2,700 to Wang Fang Kwee (“Wang”), as a reward for advancing the business interests of Coolzone with TTC. These constitute offences punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.
ii. Two counts of abetment by conspiring with Wang to cheat TTC by submitting invoices for jobs not carried out by Coolzone, an offence punishable under Section 420 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. As a result, TTC was dishonestly induced to pay a sum of $6473.50 to Coolzone, which TTC would not have done so if they had not been deceived. 

3\.        Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

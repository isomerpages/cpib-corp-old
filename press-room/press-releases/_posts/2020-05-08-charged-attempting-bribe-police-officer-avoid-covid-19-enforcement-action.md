As part of enhanced measures introduced by the Multi-Ministry Taskforce to break the COVID-19 transmission chain, everyone must wear a mask over their nose and mouth when outside of their homes unless exempted under the law<sup>1</sup>. Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020, anyone caught not wearing a mask as mandated when they leave their residence faces a fine of S$300 for the first offence and S$1,000 for repeat offenders. Those caught trying to bribe their way out of COVID-19 related offences will land themselves in more serious trouble with the law.

2\.        On 8 May 2020, Chen Long (“陈龙”), a 27-year-old Chinese national on work permit in Singapore, was charged with one count of corruptly offering S$50 to one Chan Hui Shi, a Public Transport Security Command Officer of the Singapore Police Force (SPF), as an inducement to refrain from taking enforcement action against him for breaching Regulation 3A(1)(a) of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020. This constituted an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. The offence was committed on 7 May 2020. The SPF officer refused his offer.

3\.        Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to offer bribes to avoid enforcement action. CPIB will take firm and swift action against offenders, and will work with the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) to press for deterrent sentences against them. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or imprisoned for up to 5 years or both.

4\.        The CPIB looks into all corruption complaints and reports, including anonymous ones, and can be reached via the following channels: 

a) Write to us at the CPIB Headquarters @ 2 Lengkok Bahru, S159047;<br />
b) Call the Duty Officer at 1800-376-0000;<br />
c) Lodge an [e-Complaint](/e-services/e-complaint-for-corrupt-conduct); or<br>
d) Email us at <a class="spamspan" href="mailto:report@cpib.gov.sg">report@cpib.gov.sg</a>

5\.        Where possible, the report should include the following information:

a) Where, when and how the alleged corrupt act happened?<br />
b) Who was involved and what were their roles?<br />
c) What was the bribe given and the favour shown?

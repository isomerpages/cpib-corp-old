Hew Chong Wai (“Hew”), who fled Singapore in 1987 before charges could be served on him, has been produced in Court on 13 May 2017 to face those charges. 

2\.          Hew was under investigation by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) when he fled the country in 1987. Hew was eventually located and arrested in Seremban, Malaysia, by Malaysian authorities on 11 May 2017 and was handed over to CPIB Officers on 12 May 2017 in Kuala Lumpur. 

3\.          Hew faces 128 charges of fraudulently forging documents, namely, Works Orders, with the intention of causing the Housing & Development Board (HDB) to believe that the works stated in the Works Orders had been checked and approved by two other HDB officers, which are offences punishable under Section 468 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. 

4\.        Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption and criminal activities. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau takes a serious view of any corrupt and criminal practices, and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

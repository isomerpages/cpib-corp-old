On 5 August 2015, Zhu Xiaolu, a Chinese national, was sentenced to a 3 week jail term for attempting to bribe a Singapore Customs Officer.

2\.        Zhu Xiaolu was charged in Court on 26 June 2015 for corruptly offering a gratification of US$200 to Higher Customs Officer Siow Teck Meng as an inducement to allow the release of commercial goods worth US$10,210 without having to apply for a permit, an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. The offer was rejected by the Singapore Customs Officer who reported the matter to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).

3\.        In Singapore, it is an offence to bribe, or attempt to bribe, public officers. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both.

4\.        Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The CPIB takes a serious view of any corrupt practices, and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

The giving of bribes to further business interests is an unfair and illegal practice. Individuals should never give, or agree to give gratification to gain business through such corrupt means.

2\.        On 7 August 2017, Singaporean Koh Seng Lee, Executive Director of Pacific Prime Trading Pte Ltd, will be charged in court for the following offences:

i) 19 counts of corruptly giving gratification (between July 2006 to July 2010) amounting to a sum of US$3.95 million to Chang Peng Hong Clarence, the Regional Director of Marine Fuels with BP Singapore Pte Ltd (BP), as an inducement for advancing the business interest of Pacific Prime Trading Pte Ltd with BP, an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

ii) One count of corruptly agreeing to give a gratification of S$500,000 (sometime before September 2009) to Chang Peng Hong Clarence, a Regional Director of Marine Fuels with BP Singapore Pte Ltd (BP), as an inducement for advancing the business interest of Pacific Prime Trading Pte Ltd with BP, an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.        Chang Peng Hong Clarence was charged in Court on 9 March 2017 for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act and Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act.

4\.        Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

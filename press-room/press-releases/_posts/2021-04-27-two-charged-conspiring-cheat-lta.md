On 27 April 2021, the following two individuals will be charged in Court for alleged cheating offences:

a) **Loh Yeok Lum (“Loh”)** (羅煜霖, 66-year-old male Singaporean), Driver of Sin Trans Engineering Pte Ltd (“Sin Trans”) at the time of offences; and

b) **Chua Cheng Kang (“Chua”)** (蔡清江, 64-year-old male Singaporean), Driver of Sin Trans at the time of offences.

2\.        On 21 occasions between October 2010 and April 2012, Loh and Chua allegedly engaged in a conspiracy to cheat the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) into issuing registration approval codes for Sin Trans trailers. Their alleged actions led to Inspection Officers from JIC Inspection Services Pte Ltd (“JIC”, an authorised LTA inspection centre) submitting reports to the Vehicle Inspection and Type Approval System (“VITAS”) which falsely declared the weight of Sin Trans trailers. LTA was thus deceived into believing that the trailers were compliant with the approved technical drawings when they were not. As a result, LTA issued approval codes for the registration of the trailers which it would not have done so if it was not deceived. For these actions, Loh and Chua each face 21 counts of cheating, punishable under Section 417 read with Section 109 of the *Penal Code*.

3\.        In addition, Loh is alleged to have engaged in a similar conspiracy with two JIC Inspection Officers to cheat the LTA into issuing registration approval codes for Sin Trans trailers on three occasions sometime in February 2014. For these actions, Loh faces an additional three counts of cheating, punishable under Section 417 read with Section 109 of the *Penal Code*.

4\.        Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption and other criminal activities. Any person convicted of cheating under Section 417 of the *Penal Code* can be sentenced to imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and be liable to a fine.

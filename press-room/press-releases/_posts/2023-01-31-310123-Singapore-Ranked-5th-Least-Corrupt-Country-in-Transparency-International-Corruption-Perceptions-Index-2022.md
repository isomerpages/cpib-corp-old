The Transparency International (TI) Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) 2022 has ranked Singapore the 5th least corrupt country in the world out of 180 countries with a score of 83. Singapore continues to remain the only Asian country ranked in the top 10. 

2\. The TI-CPI ranks and measures countries by their perceived levels of public sector corruption. The 2022 index draws upon 13 expert assessments and surveys of business people. Countries are then scored on a scale of zero, for highly corrupt, to 100, for very clean. TI’s 2022 report urged countries to continue the fight against corruption as it is both a key cause and result of the deteriorating global peace.

3\. The corruption situation in Singapore remains firmly under control. The [annual corruption statistics](/press-room/press-releases/050522-corruption) released by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) last year indicated that the number of public sector corruption cases has remained consistently low over the years. Singapore has also performed well across international indices for incorruptibility and clean public sector. The Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) ranked Singapore as the least corrupt country in its 2022 Report on Corruption in Asia out of 16 economies, a position we have held since 1995. In the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index 2022, Singapore was ranked 3rd for absence of corruption, the top Asian nation out of 140 countries ranked.

4\. Domestically, results from the CPIB’s recent Public Perception Survey conducted in 2022 indicated strong public confidence in our national corruption control efforts. From the biennial survey of over 1,000 respondents in Singapore, 96% rated Singapore’s corruption control efforts to be effective, an improvement from 94% in 2020. *Political determination*, *heavy punishment* for corruption offences, and a *zero tolerance culture* for corruption were the top three most important factors that contributed to the low corruption rate in Singapore.

5\. The CPIB is grateful to our partners as well as the community for their strong support in the fight against corruption. We will continue to work together towards a corruption-free Singapore.

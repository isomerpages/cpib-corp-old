6\. Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption and other criminal acts. It is a serious offence to offer bribes, or attempt to offer bribes to public officers. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to S$100,000, sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years, or both. Any person convicted for voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from the discharge of his duty is liable for an imprisonment term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine, or caning. Any person convicted for causing annoyance whilst drunk is liable for a fine of up to S$1,000, imprisonment term not exceeding six months, or both. Any person convicted for criminal intimidation is liable for an imprisonment term which may extend to two years, or fine, or both.  For non-compliance with safe-distancing measures under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, offenders can be fined up to S$10,000, face a jail term of up to six months, or both.

Law enforcement officers have the duty to maintain the rule of law and uphold justice. Those who choose to obstruct the course of justice must bear the full weight of the law. 
 
2\.        On 18 October 2019, three Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers were charged in court for the following offences:

**a) Staff Sergeant Abdul Rahman Bin Kadir, 43-year-old, Singaporean**

i) One count of engaging in a conspiracy with Muhammad Zuhairi Bin Zainuri (“Zuhairi”) and Mohamed Hafiz Bin Lan (“Hafiz”) to intentionally obstruct the course of justice by tampering with a urine sample belonging to one Maung Moe Min (“Maung”) on 16 August 2018. Hafiz had replaced Maung’s urine sample with his own urine sample in a toilet at the Woodlands Checkpoint which enabled Maung to pass the Instant Urine Test (“IUT”). This constitutes an offence punishable under Section 204A read with Section 109 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

**b) Staff Sergeant Mohamed Hafiz Bin Lan, 41-year-old, Singaporean**

i) One count of engaging in the said conspiracy with Zuhairi and Abdul Rahman Bin Kadir (“Rahman”) to intentionally obstruct the course of justice by replacing Maung’s urine sample with his own urine sample, thereby enabling Maung to pass the IUT. This constitutes an offence punishable under Section 204A read with Section 109 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

**c) Sergeant Muhammad Zuhairi Bin Zainuri, 31-year-old, Singaporean**

i) One count of engaging in the said conspiracy with Hafiz and Rahman to intentionally obstruct the course of justice by replacing Maung’s urine sample with Hafiz’s urine sample, thereby enabling Maung to pass the IUT. This constitutes an offence punishable under Section 204A read with Section 109 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
 

3\.        The case was referred to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) by the CNB.
 

4\.         Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. All public officers, including those in law enforcement, are expected to uphold the highest standards of integrity when carrying out their duties. The CPIB will not hesitate to take errant public officers to task.

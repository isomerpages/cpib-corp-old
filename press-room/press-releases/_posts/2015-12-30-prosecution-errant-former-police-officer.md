Law enforcement officers are trusted to uphold and enforce the laws. They face serious consequences when they breach that trust and errantly act against those very laws which they are to protect. 

2\.        On 24 December 2015, Yeo Lwee Siong, a 41-year-old former Senior Investigation Officer of the Singapore Police Force will be charged in Court for the following offences:

i. One count of criminal breach of trust in the capacity of a public servant, by dishonestly misappropriating restitution monies amounting to around $4,700, which belonged to the victims of a motor insurance fraud case which the accused was investigating, an offence punishable under Section 409 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008, Rev. Ed); and

ii. One count of intentionally obstructing the course of justice, by shredding documents relating to the restitution money in connection with the same motor insurance fraud case, an offence punishable under Section 204A of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev. Ed).

3\.        Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards crime and law enforcement officers are expected to uphold high standards of integrity and discipline. The authorities take a serious view of such criminal conduct and will not hesitate to take swift action against those involved.

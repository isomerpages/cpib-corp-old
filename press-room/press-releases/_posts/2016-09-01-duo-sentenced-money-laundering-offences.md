On 1 September 2016, one American male, Thomas Philip Doehrman and one Singaporean female, Lim Ai Wah were sentenced for money laundering and related offences. Thomas Philip Doehrman, Director of Quest Petroleum (Singapore) Pte Ltd, was sentenced to 70 months’ jail while Lim Ai Wah, Director of Questzone Offshore Ltd (“Questzone”), was sentenced to 60 months’ jail.     

2\.          Investigations revealed that Thomas Philip Doehrman, Lim Ai Wah and a third individual, Li Weiming, had conspired to issue an invoice to ZTE Corporation (“ZTE”) dated 15 July 2010 that falsely purported to seek payment of US$3.6 million to Questzone as a sub-contractor under a fictitious sub-contract for a community college project in Papua New Guinea (“PNG”).  A portion of that criminal proceeds were eventually disbursed to Li Weiming, a People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) National, and Sir Michael Thomas Somare, a PNG National.

3\.          Thomas Philip Doehrman and Lim Ai Wah were convicted by the Court on 22 July 2016 for the following offences:

ii. Two counts of abetment by engaging in a conspiracy with Lim Ai Wah and Li Weiming to remit a total sum of $850,000 to a Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation Bank Account in Hong Kong.

iii. Three counts of abetment by engaging in a conspiracy with Lim Ai Wah and Li Weiming to transfer a total sum of $784,000 to a Singapore Standard Chartered Bank account.

3\.          Li Weiming, who was the chief representative of China-based ZTE Corporation, has since absconded. Li had failed to show up for a Pre-Trial Conference on 20 August 2013, and a Warrant of Arrest was subsequently issued against him.

4\.          Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption and any criminal activity. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

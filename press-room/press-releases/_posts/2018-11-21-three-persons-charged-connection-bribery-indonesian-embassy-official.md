The giving or receiving of bribes for gains is illegal. Individuals should never give, receive, or solicit corrupt gratification.

**a)    Abdul Aziz Bin Mohamed Hanib, 63 years old, freelance translator**

Eight counts of corruptly receiving for another person, Agus Ramdhany Machjumi (“Agus”), an Administrative & Technical staff member of the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia, a total of around $71,200 from Yeo Siew Liang James (“James”), as a reward for Agus showing favour to James’ principals, AIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte Ltd and Liberty Insurance Pte Ltd. As a result, Agus’ principal, the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia (“the Embassy”), accredited AIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte Ltd and Liberty Insurance Pte Ltd as providers of Performance Bonds in respect of Indonesian domestic workers in Singapore.

One count of abetting Abdul Aziz bin Mohamed Hanib (“Aziz”) to corruptly solicit gratification for Agus Ramdhany Machjumi (“Agus”) from Yeo Siew Liang James (“James”) by introducing Aziz to James, knowing that Aziz was seeking corrupt gratification related to accreditation to sell Performance Bonds (in respect of Indonesian foreign domestic workers); an offence under section 5(a)(i) read with section 29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.          There is currently no evidence to suggest that AIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte Ltd, Liberty Insurance Pte Ltd and Alpha Process Solutions Pte Ltd were complicit in the corruption offences. No charges are currently being tendered against them. 

4\.          The Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia was not complicit in the corruption offences.

5\.          Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to bribe or attempt to bribe another individual or entity. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both. The CPIB will not hesitate to take firm enforcement action against any party involved in such acts.

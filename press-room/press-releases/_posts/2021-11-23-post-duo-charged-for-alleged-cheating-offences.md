On 23 November 2021, two individuals will be charged in Court for alleged cheating offences whereby air tickets were sold to two passengers at an inflated price. They are:

a) Mohamed Ashraf Mohamed Rizwan (“Ashraf”) (30-year-old male Indian National), an Accounts Executive of Jetspeed Travel Pte Ltd (“Jetspeed”) at the material time; and

b) Ravi Kumar Sam Kumar (“Ravi”) (27-year-old male Indian National), a Sales Executive of Jetspeed at the material time. 

2\. Sometime in December 2020, Ashraf had allegedly cheated one passenger of S$175, by deceiving the passenger into believing that the price of the air ticket sold to the passenger was S$500 when in fact it was S$325. Ashraf had allegedly received the cash of S$500 in person from the passenger in the transit area of the airport. In addition, sometime in March 2021, Ashraf and Ravi had allegedly cheated, with common intention, another passenger of S$75, by deceiving the passenger into believing that the price of the air ticket sold to the passenger was S$400 when in fact it was S$325. Ravi had allegedly received the cash of S$400 in person from the passenger at the Air India counter in Changi Airport Terminal 1. Both passengers had bought air tickets to return to India following the deaths of loved ones, and Jetspeed is the sole agent authorised to distribute Air India and Air India Express tickets in Singapore.

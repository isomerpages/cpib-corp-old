On 28 February 2022, Teva Raj S/O Palanisamy (“Teva”) (70-year-old male Singaporean), a former Senior Director of National Parks Board’s (“NParks”) Municipal Landscapes Division (“MLD”), was convicted and sentenced to 4 months’ imprisonment and a penalty of S$900 for corruption. 

2\. 	As Senior Director, Teva was responsible for managing the staff and operations of the MLD. Teva admitted that on six occasions between August 2018 and March 2020, he corruptly obtained gratification in the form of round-trip transport services between Singapore and Malaysia worth about S$900 from a director of an NParks sub-contractor (“the Director”), as inducement to further the business interests of the latter’s company with NParks. The Director’s company had been sub-contracted to perform grass maintenance services for NParks at the material time. The Director also worked as a Grab Hitch driver, and generally charged S$150 for a round-trip from Singapore to Johor Bahru, Malaysia.

3\.	On all six occasions, Teva had requested the said Director to drive him from Singapore to Johor Bahru, Malaysia and back so that he could attend to personal matters. On all occasions, Teva did not pay the Director for his services. This was despite Teva being aware that accepting such free services from a sub-contractor was in conflict of interest. On one occasion, when a different contractor of NParks was experiencing delays in their grass-cutting works, Teva made arrangements for the Director’s company to take over the grass-cutting works for a period of three months. In this manner, Teva advanced the business interests of the Director’s company with NParks.

4\.	For his actions, Teva was charged on 6 April 2021 under Section 6(a) read with Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241 (“PCA”) and amalgamated pursuant to section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapter 68. Another charge under Section 6(a) read with Sections 7 and 37 of the PCA was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. For this other charge, Teva had corruptly accepted gratification in the form of a Macau hotel stay worth S$258.42 from the General Manager of another contractor of NParks. 

5\.         Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both. The maximum imprisonment term for each offence of corruption can be increased to 7 years if it is in relation to a matter or contract with the Government or public body, or a subcontract to execute work comprised in such contract.

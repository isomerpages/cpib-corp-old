On 21 September 2015, Singaporean Rajendran S/O R. Kurusamy was sentenced to 48 months’ imprisonment for offences related to football match-fixing activities at the 28th South East Asian (SEA) Games.

2\.        The accused was earlier charged in Court on 30 May 2015 and 5 June 2015 with the following charges:

* One count of engaging in a conspiracy with three other persons, to corruptly agree to give gratification to one Orlando Marques Henriques Mendes, a technical director of the Timor Leste Football Association, amounting to $15,000.00, as a reward to arrange for the SEA Games Timor Leste football team to lose their match against Malaysia, an offence under Section 6(b) read with Section 29 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241;
* One count of being a party to a criminal conspiracy by agreeing to corruptly offer bribes to players of the SEA Games Timor Leste football team as an inducement to lose the same match, an offence under Section 5(b)(i) read with Section 31 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241; and
* One count of corruptly giving gratification to one Orlando Marques Henriques Mendes, a technical director of the Timor Leste Football Association, amounting to $1,000.00, as an inducement to lose the same match, an offence under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.       Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption, and match-fixing of any form is not condoned in Singapore. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in match-fixing related activities.

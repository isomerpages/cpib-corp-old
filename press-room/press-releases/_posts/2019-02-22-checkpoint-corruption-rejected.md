If not kept in check, corrupt acts can compromise border security and result in serious consequences for public security. 

2\.          On 22 February 2019, Marsari, a 42-year-old male Indonesian, was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment for attempting to bribe an Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officer.  Marsari had been charged in Court on 15 February 2019 for one count of corruptly offering gratification of $170 to Immigration Officer Zulkhairi Bin Abu Bakar, as inducement to be released from ICA’s custody, an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.          Investigations revealed that Marsari had entered Singapore from Batam via the Singapore Cruise Centre on 14 February 2019 when he was detained by ICA on a suspected case of passport tampering. Upon further checks of Marsari’s passport, Officer Zulkhairi then informed him that by producing a tampered passport to an Immigrations Officer, he had committed an offence. Marsari replied that he wanted to go home and took out $170 from his pocket to offer Officer Zulkhairi for his release from ICA’s custody. The bribe was rejected by Officer Zulkhairi and the matter was reported to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau. 

4\.          Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to give bribes, or attempt to offer bribes to another individual or entity. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

On 30 April 2021, two individuals will be charged in Court for allegedly conspiring to cheat and dishonestly induce a Director of JCL Facility Services Pte Ltd (“JCL”) into making payments totalling S$150,490 between 2017 and 2019. They are:

a) **Mohamad Nazrie Bin Rabuan (“Nazrie”)**, 38-year-old male Singaporean, Technical Executive of UEMS Solutions Pte Ltd (“UEMS”) at the material time; and

b) **Mohammad Yazid Bin Taib (“Yazid”)**, 50-year-old male Singaporean, Cleaning Supervisor of Theng Liang Lee Services Pte Ltd (“TLLS”) at the material time.

2\.        Between 2017 and 2019, Nazrie and Yazid allegedly engaged in a conspiracy to cheat and dishonestly induce a Director of JCL into paying a total of S$150,490 in salaries for cleaners, by submitting names of cleaners who purportedly worked at Kampung Admiralty and Admiralty Place when in fact they did not. These monies were transferred to a bank account held in the name of Yazid’s wife. For their actions, they each face three amalgamated charges for the offence of cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property punishable under Section 420 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code.

3\.        The CPIB takes a serious view against corruption and other criminal activities such as cheating.

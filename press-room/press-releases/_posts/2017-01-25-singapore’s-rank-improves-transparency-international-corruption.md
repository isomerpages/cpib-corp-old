In the latest Transparency International (TI) Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) results released today, Singapore attained 7th position among 176 countries and a score of 84 for the year 2016.

2\.        The TI CPI measures the perceived levels of public sector corruption globally. Countries are scored on a scale of zero, for highly corrupt, to 100, for very clean as viewed by country experts and business people. The TI CPI 2016 was constructed based on 13 data sources of which 8 of them surveyed on Singapore’s perceived level of public sector corruption.

3\.        “The TI CPI 2016 results is a testament to Singapore’s continued vigilance, commitment and zero tolerance in our fight against corruption. This result is consistent with the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC)’s 2016 Report on Corruption in Asia which ranked Singapore as the least corrupt country in Asia, a position we held since 1995. The CPIB will continue to battle corruption without fear or favour so as to uphold the highest level of integrity and incorruptibility in Singapore.” Mr Wong Hong Kuan, Director of the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau commented

4\.        As part of the Bureau’s ongoing anti-corruption efforts, the new Corruption Reporting & Heritage Centre (CRHC) located at 247 Whitley Road, Singapore 297830, is operational with effect 9 January 2017. Members of public can now make corruption complaints at this new centre, which also houses the Bureau’s heritage gallery. Those who are interested in learning more about Singapore’s anti-corruption journey and the role that CPIB plays can visit the heritage centre during the opening hours. The CRHC is open from 10am to 7pm on weekdays and 10am to 4pm on Saturdays (except public holidays).

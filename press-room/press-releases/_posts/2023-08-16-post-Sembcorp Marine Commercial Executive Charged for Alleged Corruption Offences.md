On 16 August 2023, Balakrishnan A/L Govindasamy (“Balakrishnan”) (61-year-old male Malaysian), a Commercial Executive of Sembcorp Marine Integrated Yard Private Limited at the material time, was charged in Court for allegedly committing corruption offences.

2\. Between 2015 and 2021, Balakrishnan was alleged to have corruptly obtained and attempted to obtain gratifications in the form of cash totalling at least S$202,877 from nine contractors representing different companies. These gratifications were meant as an inducement or reward for advancing the business interests of these contractors with Sembcorp Marine Integrated Yard Private Limited. For his alleged offences, Balakrishnan faces 14 charges punishable under Section 6(a) of the *Prevention of Corruption Act*, of which five charges are amalgamated under Section 124(4) of the *Criminal Procedure Code* and punishable under Section 124(8) of the *Criminal Procedure Code*.

3\. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the *Prevention of Corruption Act* can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or both. Any person who is convicted of an offence under Section 124 of the *Criminal Procedure Code* can face two times the amount of punishment liable for that offence.

4\. Companies are strongly advised to put in place robust procedures in areas such as procurement and internal audit to prevent falling victim to corrupt acts by their employees. Guidance for companies on measures to prevent corruption can be found in *[PACT: A  Practical Anti-Corruption Guide for Businesses in Singapore](https://www.cpib.gov.sg/research-room/publications/anti-corruption-guide-for-businesses/)*, which is available on CPIB’s website. Companies are also strongly encouraged to obtain certification under the *[Singapore Standard (SS) ISO 37001 – Anti-Bribery Management Systems](https://www.cpib.gov.sg/research-room/publications/ss-iso-37001/)*, which is designed to help companies implement or enhance an anti-bribery management system to reduce corporate risk and costs related to bribery.

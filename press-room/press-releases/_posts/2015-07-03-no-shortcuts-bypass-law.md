Singaporeâ€™s law enforcement officers have been entrusted by the public to act with integrity, especially in their course of duty. Anyone who attempts to bribe them will be taken to task.

2\.        On 3 July 2015, Hwang Eunmi, a South Korean national, will be charged in Court for having allegedly corruptly offered gratification of $1,550 in cash to five police officers as an inducement to refrain from arresting her in relation to prostitution activities, an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. The offer was rejected by the police officers, who reported the matter to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).

3\.        In Singapore, it is an offence to bribe, or attempt to bribe, public officers. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both.

4\.        Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The CPIB takes a serious view of any corrupt practices, and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

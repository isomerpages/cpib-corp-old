On 9 February 2022, Chuah Khai Huat (蔡開發) was sentenced to 22 weeks' imprisonment and a penalty of S$4,500 for corruption offences. Chuah, a 60-year-old
Singaporean male, was a Resident Engineer employed by CPG Consultants Pte Ltd (“CPG”) at the material time of the offences. He was assigned to be attached to a Taman Jurong Nursing Home (“TJNH”) construction site at Yuan Ching Road.

2\.	Based on investigations by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”), the Ministry of Health had engaged M/s Chiu Teng Construction Co Ltd (“Chiu Teng”) to be its main contractor for the TJNH project. Chiu Teng in turn engaged M/s Glory Construction Pte Ltd (“Glory Construction”) to carry out structural works. CPG was the consultant for the project. As the Resident Engineer assigned by CPG to be attached to the TJNH construction site, Chuah was tasked with inspecting the works done by the contractors at the TJNH site. If the works were not done according to specified requirements, Chuah would not sign off the inspection forms to approve the works done which would result in the contractors not being able to carry out its next phase of work.


3\.	Investigations further revealed that Chuah had corruptly accepted bribes totalling
S$4,500 from one Dai Jun (“Dai”), a Site Manager of Glory Construction, as an inducement for him to not cause delay in piling works carried out at the TJNH construction site and to not create problems for Glory Construction in its works carried out at the TJNH construction site. Delay in the piling works would in turn hold-up Glory Construction’s commencement of structural works at the site. Chuah was charged in court on 12 April 2018 for two counts of obtaining gratification, offences punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
 
4\.	Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to obtain or accept bribes. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to S$100,000 or jailed up to 5 years or to both.

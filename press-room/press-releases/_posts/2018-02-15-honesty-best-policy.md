Under Singaporeâ€™s law, it is an offence for any person to knowingly give false or misleading information to law enforcement officers.

2\.        On 15 February 2018, one Tan Tong Han will be charged in Court with two counts of knowingly giving false information to a Special Investigator of the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, an offence punishable under Section 28(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.        Tan had allegedly told the CPIB officer that the sum of $547,819.53 transferred from the bank account of Pamodzi Consulting Sarl to the bank account of Black Tidings on 27 March 2014 was payment for sponsorship servicing and consultancy services, which he knew to be false. Moreover, he also gave false information that one John Pierre Bonor or someone impersonating one Papa Massata Diack had tricked him into transferring the sum of $524,064.90 from the bank account of Black Tidings to the bank account of one Shobukhov Igor.

4\.        Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption and other criminal acts. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

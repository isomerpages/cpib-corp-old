2\.         On 25 November 2016, one Su Fengxian, the mother of ex-Singapore National Table Tennis player Li Hu, will be charged in Court for one count of corruptly offering gratification of EUR 2,000 to Loy Soo Han, the Technical Director of Singapore Table Tennis Association (STTA), as an inducement to show leniency in an STTA investigation involving Li Hu, an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

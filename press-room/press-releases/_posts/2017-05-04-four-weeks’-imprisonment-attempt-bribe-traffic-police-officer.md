On 4 May 2017, Sang Jia Weng (“Sang”), a Malaysian, was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment for attempting to bribe a Traffic Police Officer.

2\.        Sang was earlier charged in Court on 19 April 2017 with one count of corruptly offering gratification to Staff Sergeant (SSGT) Zulkifli Bin Dzahari, as an inducement to refrain from issuing a traffic summons to Sang, an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.        The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) had received information on 11 January 2017 that Sang, a construction worker working in Singapore, had offered S$30 to SSGT Zulkifli after being stopped for failing to secure his helmet strap while riding his motorcycle. When he was stopped and informed of his offence, Sang had stuffed three SGD$10 Dollar notes into SSGT Zulkifli’s trouser pocket, asking him not to issue him a traffic summons. SSGT Zulkifli immediately placed Sang under arrest.

4\.        In Singapore, it is an offence to bribe, or attempt to bribe public officers. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both.

5\.        Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The CPIB takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

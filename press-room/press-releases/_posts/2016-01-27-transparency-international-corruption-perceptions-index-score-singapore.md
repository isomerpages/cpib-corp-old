Transparency International (TI) has released the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) for 2015 on 27 January 2016. Singapore’s CPI score improved from 84 points in 2014 to 85 points, once again placing ahead of all other major Asian economies. Singapore attained 7th* position out of 168 countries ranked by the corruption watchdog for 2015.

2\.          The CPI measures the perceived levels of public sector corruption worldwide. Countries are scored on a scale of zero, for highly corrupt, to 100, for very clean as viewed by country experts and business people. There are 12 sources of data from various corruption-related polls and surveys that were used to construct the TI CPI 2015. Eight of these data sources were used to compute Singapore’s CPI score, out of which Singapore attained top scores for four of these data sources.

3\.          Singapore continues to be one of the least corrupt countries in the world and the Republic’s public sector remains as one of the cleanest. This is testament to Singapore’s continued vigilance, commitment and zero-tolerance approach in our fight against corruption. The TI-CPI 2015 results also attest that corruption in Singapore remains under control, with the number of corruption complaints and cases registered for investigations by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) at 30-year lows.

12 males and 2 females (aged between 38 and 60 years old) have been arrested on suspicion of being part of an organised crime group involved with match fixing activities.

2\.         The 12-hour joint operation, which ended in the early hours of 17 September 2013 (Tuesday) was led by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) with support from the Police Intelligence Department. Officers raided various locations in different parts of Singapore to apprehend these persons.

3\.         Police confirm that the suspected leader and several other individuals who are the subject of ongoing investigations in other jurisdictions for match fixing activities were amongst the persons arrested.

4\.         The arrested persons are being investigated for offences related to match fixing activities under the Prevention of Corruption Act (Chapter 241) and for their involvement in organised crime activities.

5\.         Five of these arrested persons, including the suspected leader, are being further detained pursuant to the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Chapter 67) pending further investigations. The remaining nine persons will be released on police bail.

6\.         Singapore is committed to eradicate match-fixing as a transnational crime and protect the integrity of the sport. All cases will be pursued vigorously with a view to bring perpetrators to justice. We appreciate the assistance rendered by the INTERPOL Global AntiMatch-fixing Taskforce thus far, and will continue to work with the Taskforce and the global community in our fight against global match-fixing.

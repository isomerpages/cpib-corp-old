The giving or receiving of bribes to advance business interest is an unfair and illegal practice. Individuals should never give corrupt gratification to gain business.

2\.          On 19 February 2019, a 45-year-old Indian National, Sarva Subramanian Srilal, the sole proprietor of SSS Team, will be charged for corruptly giving gratification on multiple occasions totaling $57,230 to 42-year-old Malaysian Suresh Krishnan (“Suresh”), Business Excellence Manager of Flextronics Manufacturing (S) Pte Ltd ("Flex”) to advance the business interest of SSS Team with Flex. This constitutes an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act Chapter 241, which is an amalgamated charge pursuant to section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapter 68.

3\.          Suresh was charged with corruption on 15 December 2018 and the case is currently before the Court. 

4\.          Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to give bribes, or attempt to give bribes to another individual or entity in return for favours. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

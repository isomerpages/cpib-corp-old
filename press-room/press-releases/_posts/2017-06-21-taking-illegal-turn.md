On 21 June 2017, one Li Qi Gang, a Chinese national, was sentenced to three weeksâ€™ imprisonment for his attempt to bribe an Authorized Automotive Tester.

2\.        Li was charged on 8 June 2017 for corruptly offering gratification to Goh King Seng, an Authorized Automotive Tester from Singapore Safety Driving Centre, as an inducement to assess Li as having passed his driving test, an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Cap 241.

3\.         Investigations revealed that the incident occurred on 15 December 2016. As Li had committed several mistakes during the driving test, he offered Goh $500 as he thought this would help him to pass the driving test. Goh did not accept the bribe and the matter was referred to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau.

4\.         In Singapore, it is an offence to bribe, or attempt to offer a bribe. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both.

5\.         Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

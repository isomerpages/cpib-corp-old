On 22 July 2020, **Liu Huibin (“Liu”)**, 刘会宾, was convicted and sentenced to two months and two weeks’ imprisonment for offences under the Penal Code and Prevention of Corruption Act.

2\.       Liu, a 44-year-old male Chinese national, was spotted smoking at the void deck of a block in Sumang Link on 27 January 2020 by two Certis Cisco Auxiliary Police Force Pte Ltd (“CISCO”) officers. Aruna Magathevan (“Aruna”) is an authorised auxiliary police officer of the National Environment Agency (“NEA”) and Mohammed Latiff Bin Mohd Ali (“Mohammed”) is an enforcement officer attached to the NEA.

3\.       Investigations revealed that the two officers approached Liu intending to issue him a Notice to Attend Court as Liu had committed an offence of smoking in a specified place under Section 3(2) of the Smoking (Prohibition in Certain Places) Act. Upon understanding the offence he had committed, Liu tried to walk away from the scene but was stopped by Aruna and Mohammed. As Liu was unwilling to produce his particulars, the officers called for the police and asked Liu to wait for the arrival of the police officers.

4\.       While waiting for the police to arrive, Liu attempted to leave the scene and grabbed the wrist of one of the CISCO officers. He then pushed her shoulder which resulted in the officer suffering a bruise on her left wrist. Liu subsequently took out $12 (one $10 note and one $2 note) and corruptly offered the notes to both officers as an inducement for them to not take any enforcement action against him for smoking in a specified place. Both officers rejected his offer.

5\.       Officers from Ang Mo Kio Police Division responded to the incident and established Liu’s identity. He was subsequently charged in Court on 9 July 2020 with voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty punishable under Section 332 of the Penal Code; and corruptly offering gratification to two officers, which constituted an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

6\.        The CPIB would like to commend Aruna and Mohammed for their acts of integrity. The police and CPIB adopt a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption and the assault of any public officers performing their duty. These are serious offences. Anyone convicted of the offence of voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty punishable under Section 332 of the Penal Code will be liable to an imprisonment term of up to 7 years and a fine or to caning. For a corruption offence, anyone who is convicted will be liable to a fine of up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

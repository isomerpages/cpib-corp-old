Leveraging corrupt transactions to support business dealings is illegal and must not be tolerated. 

2\.          On 1 August 2019, Kolanji Govindan (“Kolanji”), a 47-year-old male Indian National, was fined $30,000 for corruption. He was also ordered to pay a penalty of $20,000. 

3\.          At the time of the offences, Kolanji was employed as a Site Manager with Singapore Piling & Civil Engineering Pte Ltd (“SPCE”). In 2014, SPCE engaged MS Brothers Scaffolding & Engineering Pte Ltd (“MS Brothers”) for scaffolding support works. Investigations by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) revealed that on six occasions during the period July to November 2014, Murugesan Moorthy (“Moorthy”), the Operations Manager of MS Brothers had passed a total of $20,000 to Kolanji. Kolanji had accepted the money knowing that it was in exchange for Kolanji recommending MS Brothers to SPCE for the scaffolding works. 

4\.          Kolanji was charged on 30 May 2019 with six counts of corruptly accepting gratification from Moorthy as an inducement for advancing the business interests of MS Brothers with SPCE, an offence punishable under section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

5\.          Separately, Moorthy (who was charged earlier) was sentenced to 14 weeks’ imprisonment with effect from 16 May 2019. 

6\.          Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to give or accept bribes from another individual or entity. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

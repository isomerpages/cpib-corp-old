On 22 November 2022, Poo Tze Chiang (“Poo”) (符志强 , 45-year-old male Singaporean), a Police Officer of the Singapore Police Force at the material time, was charged in Court for allegedly committing corruption and obstruction of justice offences. Another individual, Ng Chuan Seng (“Ng”) (黄泉胜, 51-year-old male Singaporean) was also charged for allegedly committing an offence of abetment of corruption.

Alleged Corruption Offences 

2\. Between 2019 and 2020, over seven occasions, Poo was alleged to have corruptly accepted or obtained gratifications in the form of cash and loans amounting to $32,500, from Cordell Chan Yuen Kwang (“Chan”) and Wang Huate (“Wang”). The gratifications were allegedly inducements for Poo to provide information and assistance to Chan and Wang regarding Police investigations against them. On one occasion in September 2019, Ng was alleged to have intentionally aided Chan and Wang to corruptly give Poo a red packet containing S$2,000 in cash. Poo faces seven charges for offences punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, and Ng faces one charge for an offence of abetment of corruption punishable under Section 6(b) read with Section 29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

Alleged Obstruction of Justice Offences

3\. On or about 5 August 2020, Poo was alleged to have informed Chan that Wang would be detained if Wang reported for bail. While Poo was at a void deck in the Bukit Batok vicinity, Poo was also alleged to have flashed his Police Warrant Card at two other Police Officers patrolling in the area, so that they would not conduct any checks on Chan and Wang who were with Poo. Further on 25 November 2020, in the same Bukit Batok vicinity, Poo was alleged to have informed Chan that he had spotted a colleague’s car and that Chan should head to a nearby coffeeshop. Poo faces three additional charges for offences punishable under Section 204A(a) of the Penal Code.

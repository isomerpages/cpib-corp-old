The effects and consequences of corruption are sometimes far-reaching and damaging. Though it may remain unseen and you may not feel its effects now, it can impact you in the future and in more ways than one. By then, it might be too late. The fight against corruption is a constant one and we must always remain vigilant to make sure corruption does not take root in our society. We can all play a part in combating it, so let us stand united and do our part to stamp out corruption.

2\.        That is the message for the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau’s (CPIB) ***Unite Against Corruption Roadshow*** that will be held at Toa Payoh’s HDB Hub Mall on Saturday, 13 December 2014 from 9.30am to 6.00pm. This annual roadshow aims to reach out to the community and engage them on the topic of corruption.

3\.        Visitors and participants to the Roadshow would learn more about how they can play a part in the fight against corruption. There will be an array of activities including a skit, games and quizzes to engage the young and old alike. There will also be an exhibition giving the public a glimpse of CPIB’s history, some significant cases the Bureau has dealt with and the ingredients essential in Singapore’s fight against corruption.

4\.        The Roadshow is also an opportunity to recognise the wonderful work that went into the making of the 35 winning entries of the ***Unite Against Corruption Video Competition***. These winning pieces from the 95 submissions in the Secondary School/Junior College, Institutes of Higher Learning and Open categories stood out and impressed the judges. The wider public was also invited to pick the Viewer’s Choice Award by voting for their favourite video from the short listed winning entries on Youtube. The public’s choice will be revealed at the Roadshow.

5\.        This year, the CPIB is pleased to partner the Football Association of Singapore for the Roadshow in the collaboration to fight corruption and match-fixing.

6\.        Working with the community is an important part of CPIB’s fight against corruption and this Roadshow is one such initiative to engage the public. CPIB will continue to combat corruption without fear or favour through swift and sure, firm but fair action.

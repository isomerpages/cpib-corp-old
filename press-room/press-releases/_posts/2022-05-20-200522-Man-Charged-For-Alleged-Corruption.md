On 20 May 2022, Kong Lingjian (“Kong”) (38-year-old male Chinese National) was charged in Court for alleged corruption.

2\. On 26 March 2022, at around Old Choa Chu Kang Road, Kong allegedly offered gratification of an unspecified sum to Paneer Selvam s/o Raja Anthiran (“Paneer”), an Operations Executive with Sungei Tengah Lodge (“STL”), as an inducement to allow Kong to leave the area near the STL before officers from the Singapore Police Force arrived. Paneer rejected the bribe offer, and the case was subsequently referred to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). For his action, Kong faces a charge for an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

3\. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both. 

4\. CPIB looks into all corruption-related complaints and reports, including anonymous ones, and can be reached via the following channels:

a) Lodge an [e-Complaint](/e-services/e-complaint-for-corrupt-conduct);<br>
b) Email us at <a class="spamspan" href="mailto:report@cpib.gov.sg">report@cpib.gov.sg</a>;<br />
c) Call the Duty Officer at 1800-376-0000; or<br />
d) Write to us at the CPIB Headquarters @ 2 Lengkok Bahru, S159047.

5\. Where possible, the report should include the following information:

a) Where, when and how the alleged corrupt act happened?<br />
b) Who was involved and what were their roles?<br />
c) What was the bribe given and the favour shown?

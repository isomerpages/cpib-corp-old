On 24 November 2020, **Teo Hwee Peng (张伟平, 47-year-old male Singaporean)** [“Teo”], a Checkpoints Inspector of the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority of Singapore (“ICA”), will be charged in Court for corruptly obtaining gratification in various forms, in particular money and sex, from two female Chinese Nationals; these were obtained in return for helping them to remain in Singapore by arranging for them to be issued with a Special Pass. Teo’s alleged offences are as follows:

a) Between 2018 and 2019, he corruptly attempted to obtain an Apple iPhone X from Liang Qinglan (“Liang”) as an inducement for him to arrange for Liang to be issued with a Special Pass so that she could remain in Singapore. Teo also corruptly obtained gratification in the form of free sex, and corruptly accepted a red packet containing RMB188.88 from Liang for the same purpose. He subsequently corruptly obtained from Liang, cash of at least S$2,100, loans amounting to about RMB7000 and sex on another occasion, as rewards for making the said arrangements for Liang to remain in Singapore. All these amounted to 9 charges for offences punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

b) In July 2019, he corruptly attempted to obtain about S$1,500, and corruptly obtained gratification in the form of a free massage and masturbation from Cheng Wenjuan (“Cheng”), as inducements to  arrange for Cheng to be issued with a Special Pass so that she could remain in Singapore. He also corruptly agreed to accept an unspecified amount of money from Cheng in the future as a reward for the said arrangements. All these amounted to 3 charges for offences punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

2\.        In relation to the alleged offences committed by Teo, the two Chinese Nationals will be correspondingly charged for the following:

a) **Liang Qinglan (梁青兰, a 37-year-old female Chinese National)**. Between 2018 and 2019, she corruptly agreed to give Teo an Apple iPhone X, and corruptly gave gratification in the form of free sex on 2 occasions, a red packet containing RMB188.88, cash of at least S$2,100 and loans amounting to about RMB7000. These gratifications were allegedly inducements or rewards for Teo to arrange for a Special Pass to be issued to Liang so that she could remain in Singapore. All these amounted to 9 charges for offences punishable under Section 6(b) of Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

b) **Cheng Wenjuan (成文娟, a 32-year-old female Chinese National)**. In July 2019, she corruptly agreed to give about S$1,500 to Teo, and corruptly gave Teo gratification in the form of a free massage and masturbation, as rewards or inducements for Teo to arrange for Cheng to be issued with a Special Pass so that she could remain in Singapore. For the same purpose, she also corruptly offered about S$500 to Teo which he rejected. Separately on 26 July 2019, she corruptly offered an unspecified sum to Teo as an inducement to provide her information on the arrest status of one Hu Youai. All these amounted to 4 charges for offences punishable under Section 6(b) of Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.         Cheng will also be charged with separate corruption offences allegedly committed in connection with another individual, Kelvin Lim Chee Wee (林志伟, a 42-year-old male Singaporean) [“Lim”], a manager of a motor vehicle workshop at the material time of the offences. Lim had allegedly lied to Cheng that he used to work at ICA and had friends in the immigration department who could help Cheng remain in Singapore by arranging for her to be issued with a Special Pass. However, this was not true as Lim had never worked at ICA. Nonetheless, Cheng had allegedly given Lim corrupt gratifications in form of sex and cash as inducements for him to make such arrangements. Cheng and Lim’s corresponding charges are summarised as follows:

**Cheng Wenjuan (成文娟, a 32-year-old female Chinese National)**

a) Between May and July 2019, corruptly giving Lim gratifications in the form of free sex on 8 occasions, cash amounting to S$7,000 and RMB1,000 as inducements to arrange for a purported ICA officer to help her remain in Singapore by arranging for her to be issued with a Special Pass. All these amounted to 12 charges for offences punishable under Section 5(b)(ii) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

b) In addition, in July 2019, corruptly giving Lim about S$2,000 and RMB3,000 for the benefit of a purported ICA officer to help one Lei Guoxiang remain in Singapore by arranging for her (“Lei”) to be issued with a Special Pass. All these amounted to 2 charges for offences punishable under Section 5(b)(ii) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

**Kelvin Lim Chee Wee (林志伟, a 42-year-old male Singaporean)**

a) Between May and July 2019, corruptly receiving gratifications in the form of free sex on 8 occasions, as well as soliciting from Cheng a total of S$7,000 and RMB1,000 as inducements to arrange for a purported ICA officer to help Cheng remain in Singapore by arranging for her to be issued with a Special Pass. All these amounted to 12 charges for offences punishable under Section 5(a)(ii) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

b) In addition, in July 2019, corruptly soliciting from Cheng about S$2,000 and RMB3,000 for the benefit of a purported ICA officer to help one Lei Guoxiang remain in Singapore by arranging for Lei to be issued with a Special Pass. All these amounted to 2 charges for offences punishable under Section 5(a)(ii) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

4\.        Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

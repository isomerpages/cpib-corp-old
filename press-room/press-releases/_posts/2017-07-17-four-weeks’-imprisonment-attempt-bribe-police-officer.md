On 17 July 2017, one Yelena Kalugina, a Kazakhstan national, was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment for her attempt to bribe a Singapore Police Officer.

2\.        Kalugina had been charged in court on 30 June 2017 with one count of corruptly offering $2,150 to Inspector Loh Loong Ee of the Singapore Police Force, as an inducement not to arrest her, an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Cap 241.

3\.        The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) had received information on 28 June 2017 that Kalugina had offered gratification to a Police Officer (Inspector Loh) while being questioned for suspected illegal activities. Investigations revealed that Kalugina had offered $2,150 in cash to Inspector Loh in exchange for not arresting her. This was despite being warned by Inspector Loh that it is an offence to bribe police officers in Singapore. Inspector Loh rejected the bribe and placed Kalugina under arrest. The attempted bribery was subsequently referred to CPIB.

4\.        In Singapore, it is an offence to bribe, or attempt to bribe public officers. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both.

5\.        Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

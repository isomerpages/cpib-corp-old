Bribery of public officers is a serious offence and will be firmly dealt with. On 12 October 2017, Chinese National Lin Xiurong was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment for corruptly giving cash to an Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officer.

2\.        Lin had been charged in court on 18 January 2017 with one count of corruptly giving gratification amounting to $200 to Arman Bin Jamair, an ICA Officer, as an inducement to allow her entry into Singapore, an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.        Investigations had revealed that on 5 December 2016, Lin was being escorted by ICA officer Arman to the Immigration Duty Officer counter at Changi Airport for further questioning after she had flown into Singapore from Thailand. While walking to the counter, Lin pulled out a stack of four $50 notes and stuffed the money into the ICA officer Arman’s jacket pocket to grant her entry into Singapore. ICA officer Arman did not accept the bribe and a report was subsequently made with the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).

4\.        In Singapore, it is an offence to bribe, or attempt to bribe, public officers. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both.

5\.        Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The CPIB takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.

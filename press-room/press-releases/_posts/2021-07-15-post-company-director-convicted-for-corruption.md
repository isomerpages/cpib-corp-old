On 15 July 2021, Tan Chee Keong (Tan) (陈志强), a 51-year-old Singaporean male, was sentenced to 42 weeks' imprisonment for corruption offences.

2\. At the material time of the offences, Tan was the Director of Hai Hup Huat Marine Pte Ltd and its related entities (Hai Hup Huat). Hai Hup Huat was in the business of providing stevedore/boat services to shipping agencies, ship owners as well as maritime companies for the purpose of transporting passengers or cargo to and from shore and vessels. As the company director, Tan was the overall-in-charge of Hai Hup Huat, overseeing all of the companies’ functions which included operations and accounts.

3\.        Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau’s (CPIB) investigations revealed that between 2008 and 2015, Tan would give monies to boarding officers and shipping agents under the guise of ‘commissions’, ‘referral fees’ or ‘loans’. These were in fact corrupt gratifications to induce the boarding officers and shipping agents to continue to engage Hai Hup Huat’s services in future. Tan would either make the corrupt payments personally or rely on his accounting and/or administrative staff to make them. Over the said period, Tan had given or approved the giving of corrupt gratification amounting to $211,880 to 40 individuals over at least 390 instances. These actions constituted offences punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241, of which 35 charges are amalgamated charges pursuant to section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapter 68.

4\.        Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both. 

5\.        CPIB looks into all corruption complaints and reports, including anonymous ones, and can be reached via the following channels:

The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) has been proactively monitoring football match-fixing activities in Singapore particularly with the kick-off of the 28th South East Asian (SEA) Games football tournament scheduled to commence on 29 May 2015. Acting swiftly on information received, CPIB mounted an operation that spanned from the late hours of the 28th to the early hours of the 29th of May that resulted in the arrests of a Singaporean alleged match- fixer, and several co-conspirators of different nationalities. Some members from the Timor Leste SEA Games football team are also assisting the Bureau in its investigations.

2\.        Investigations are still ongoing against the arrested persons for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act (Chapter 241).

3\.        Singapore has always adopted a zero tolerance approach towards corruption, and match fixing of any form is not condoned in Singapore. The CPIB will not hesitate to take action against any parties involved, if they have given, received, or offered bribes to fix a match.

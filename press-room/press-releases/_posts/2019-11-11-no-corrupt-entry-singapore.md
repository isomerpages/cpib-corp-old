On 11 November 2019, Bukari Salam Kuka (“Bukari”), a 31-year-old Ghanaian, was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment for attempting to bribe a Certis Cisco officer. Bukari was earlier charged in Court on 24 October 2019 for one count of corruptly offering gratification of an unspecified sum of money to Mohammad Aijaz Ahmad, a Certis Cisco Pass Office Supervisor, to assist Bukari to enter Singapore or allow him to travel to another country other than his country of origin i.e. Ghana. This constituted an offence punishable under Section 5(b)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

2\.          Investigations revealed that Bukari had transited through Singapore to arrive at Phnom Penh, Cambodia for a holiday. However, he was denied entry into Cambodia and returned to Singapore on 23 October 2019. At Changi Airport, Bukari was interviewed by an Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officer and was informed that arrangements would be made for him to take a flight back to Ghana. In the meantime, Bukari was escorted to a holding room for persons who were denied entry into Singapore. Mohammad Aijaz Ahmad (“Aijaz”), was responsible for attending to certain administrative matters concerning Bukari. After Aijaz had performed his duty, Bukari offered to pay Aijaz an unspecified sum of money in return for helping him to enter Singapore or be allowed to travel to another country other than Ghana. Aijaz rejected the bribe offer and the matter was subsequently reported to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).

3\.          The CPIB would like to commend Mohammad Aijaz Ahmad for his act of integrity. If not kept in check, corrupt acts can compromise border security and result in serious consequences for public security and safety. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to bribe, or attempt to offer bribes to another individual or entity. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

4\.          The The CPIB looks into all corruption complaints and reports, including anonymous ones, and can be reached via the following channels:

a) Visit or write to us at the CPIB Headquarters @ 2 Lengkok Bahru, S159047 or Corruption Reporting & Heritage Centre @ 247 Whitley Road S297830;<br />

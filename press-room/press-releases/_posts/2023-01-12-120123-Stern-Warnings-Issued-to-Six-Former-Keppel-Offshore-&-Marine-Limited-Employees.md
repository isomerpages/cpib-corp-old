title: "Stern Warnings Issued to Six Former Keppel Offshore & Marine Limited Employees"

The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”) has completed its investigations, and in consultation with the Attorney-General’s Chambers (“AGC”), issued stern warnings on 11 January 2023 to six individuals who were formerly senior management staff of Keppel Offshore & Marine Limited (“KOM”). 

2\. The stern warnings were issued to the six individuals in lieu of prosecution for offences punishable under the Prevention of Corruption Act (“PCA”).

3\. The offences relate to bribe payments to officials of Brazilian state-owned corporation Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (“Petrobras”), pertaining to rigs-building contracts which Petrobras and/or its related companies had awarded to KOM. Under the global resolution led by the Department of Justice of the United States of America and involving Brazil and Singapore, a conditional warning in lieu of prosecution was issued to KOM for offences punishable under the PCA. KOM has paid a total fine of US$422 million and fulfilled all obligations under the conditional warning. 

4\. CPIB conducted investigations into the six individuals who had allegedly conspired with each other to give bribe payments totalling about US$55 million to foreign consultants involved in KOM’s business interests in Brazil. These consultants then used these monies to pay bribes to Petrobras officials. 

5\. This case is complex and transnational, involving multiple authorities and witnesses from several countries. There are evidentiary difficulties in cases of such nature. Many of the documents are located in different jurisdictions. In addition, key witnesses are located outside of Singapore and cannot be compelled to give evidence here. The decision whether to prosecute the six individuals for criminal offences has to take into consideration all relevant factors, such as the culpability of each individual, the available evidence and what is appropriate in the circumstances. Having taken these into consideration, stern warnings were issued to the six individuals.

6\. CPIB and AGC would like to thank our international partners for their assistance in this case.

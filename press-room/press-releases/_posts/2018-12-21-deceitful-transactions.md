It is illegal for employees to intentionally deceive and mislead their employers with false or erroneous documents, receipts or accounts.  

2\.          On 21 December 2018, Teo Cheng Kit (張清吉), a 51-year-old male Singaporean, was charged in court for corruption and cheating offences.  Teo, a former assistant general manager of CWT Logistics Pte Ltd (“CWT”), was charged with one count of deceiving CWT with an email from ETW Logistics Pte Ltd (“ETW”) containing a false statement which was intended to mislead CWT, an offence punishable under section 6(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

3\.          Teo has also been charged with 988 counts of cheating employees of CWT, by deceiving them into believing that he had declared to the Chief Executive Officer of CWT, that his wife, Yanti Rusly, is the sole director and shareholder of ETW, an offence under Section 417 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. As a result, between February 2012 and June 2014, the CWT employees were dishonestly induced to award freight jobs amounting to approximately $635,000 to ETW, which they would not have done so if they had not been deceived. 
 
4\.    The CPIB takes a serious view against corruption and any other criminal activities.  Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

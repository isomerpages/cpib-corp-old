The rigour of driving tests helps to enhance public safety on roads. Those who attempt to corruptly undermine the integrity of such tests will have to face the consequences.      

2\.       On 2 April 2020, Kyaw Zay Aung (“Kyaw”), a 39-year-old Myanmar national on work permit in Singapore, will be charged with one count of corruptly offering $400/- to one Amme Bin Ithnain, a Driving Tester employed under ST Engineering Land Systems Ltd and posted to Bukit Batok Driving Centre, as an inducement to allow Kyaw to pass his driving test, but which offer was not accepted by Amme Bin Ithanain. This constituted an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241. The offence was committed on 20 September 2019.

3\.        Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to offer bribes to another individual. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 5 years or to both.

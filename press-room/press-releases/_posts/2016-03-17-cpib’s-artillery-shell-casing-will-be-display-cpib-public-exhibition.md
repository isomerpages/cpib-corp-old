The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) is honoured to receive an artillery shell casing collected from the 21-gun salute fired by the 21st Battalion, Singapore Artillery during the State Funeral Procession of founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. 

2\.         The late Mr Lee Kuan Yew knew that Singapore’s survival and success depended on keeping Singapore corruption-free and having a clean government imbued with the values of honesty and integrity. Recognising the CPIB’s instrumental role in keeping the system clean, the late Mr Lee backed the Bureau with the resources, the legislation and the independence to carry out its work without fear or favour. 

3\.         The CPIB’s shell casing will be on public display as part of CPIB’s upcoming exhibition “Declassified – Corruption Matters” held from 7 April to 22 May 2016 at The Plaza @ National Library. The public exhibition, which will be launched by Guest-of-Honour Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 7 April, charts Singapore’s anti-corruption journey and shares the CPIB officers’ experiences in their fight against corruption.

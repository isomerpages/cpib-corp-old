“Wherever corruption manifests itself, there are a hundred strategems to suck out the lifeblood of the people. How can one imagine that the wealth of the region would not be exhausted in the space of a few years?” Xu Wenbi, 18th Century Magistrate in Sichuan province

Chief Secretary Mrs Anson Chan
Mr W K Lam, Secretary for the Civil Service
Commissioner Mrs Lily Yam
Friends
Ladies and Gentlemen:

  I bring you greetings from my colleagues in Singapore. We are very happy with the regular exchange of visits at the Policy Secretary level which we have with you, the cross-appointment of senior officials on various boards and councils, and the cross attachment of officials. The sharing of views and experience are, without a doubt, of mutual benefit. My colleagues welcome them.

2\.        Thank you for the invitation to speak to you this morning. I count it a real privilege and opportunity. When Mr Lam first invited me to speak, I readily agreed without being entirely clear what exactly I was supposed to speak about. When I learnt about this seminar and its focus on maintaining integrity in the civil service into the 21st century, I began to wonder whether it was the wisest of decisions on my part to volunteer to speak. Because looking into the future is not something that anyone sensible should want to stick his neck out on.

3\.        There is an Arab saying which goes: “He who predicts the future lies, even if he speaks the truth.” We face a world where the only constant is change, where the rate of change itself is increasing, where uncertainty and unpredictability rule the day, where the confluence of political, economic and technological driving forces continually threaten us with a loss of ability to control events and manage outcomes.

4\.        Clearly in Singapore’s case, our smallness dictates that we cannot expect to much influence what goes on around us. We have to submit ourselves to the vagaries of events beyond our control in the region and across the world, yet we have to be well prepared to meet the future in a way which can ensure our survival and success. Add to this the fact that we have a people used to economic success and social progress for more than 30 years, with good education and rising expectations, and we define some of the most important challenges Singapore faces for the 21st Century: a more demanding and critical population, an external environment more fluid and less predictable, a world more linked up by Information Technology yet more competitive as states drive for talent, investments and markets. What kind of a Civil Service do we require to face up to such challenges?

5\.        Before attempting to look at the kind of Civil Service we require for the 21st Century, it is well to look at what we have and we got here. Someone has analysed all fatal failures as the result of one or more of the following failures:
<ul>
  <li>A failure to learn from the past</li>
  <li>A failure to adapt to the present</li>
  <li>A failure to anticipate the future</li>
</ul>

Thus before dwelling on the future, I should spend some time looking at the past and describing the present.

6\.        Any discussion on corruption involves subjective considerations of politics, ethics and pragmatism. A country anti-corruption strategy ought to be part of its broader governance and capacity-building strategy. The issue of corruption in Singapore is inextricably woven with the issue of governance: What do we believe is the best way of running the country so that our citizens may have the best chances of a good life? Corruption is not simply a moral issue. Nor is it just a potential “non-tariff barrier” in world trade. Corruption is an important element for the formula which, in our view, offers the best chances for Singapore’s survival, security and success.

7\.        It is a fundamental tenet of governance in Singapore that every citizen must instinctively understand that “No one owes Singapore an existence” and “No one owes Singapore a living”. Singapore is a country devoid of natural resources: it survives and prospers because the people with the government strive to make it so. A critical foundational principle in the governance of Singapore is:

**Reward for Work; Work for Reward**
<ul>
<li>Eschew nepotism and corruption</li>
  <li>Meritocracy for best use of talent</li>
  <li>Level the playing field with maximum investment in education</li>
</ul>
No one is to presume upon getting ahead on the basis of connection or favour.

8\.        Singapore’s corruption-free government and business environment has been a significant factor in the country’s economic and social progress. Syndicated corruption is rare and corruption in the public service, when it does occur, is isolated and largely confined to lower level officers. This corruption-free environment is a source of strategic competitive advantage for the country. A World Bank survey (World Development Report 1997: The State in a Changing World) of firms in 69 countries found “a strong correlation” between economic growth and private investment, and the credibility of governments. The latest empirical analysis also demonstrates that although the effects of corruption are complex and varied, it clearly exerts a negative impact upon social development (The Asian Development Bank, Anti-Corruption Policy, Working Paper, 1998).

9\.        In terms of social progress, Singaporeans have grown up under a Government which places the greatest emphasis on a corruption-free leadership, and have come to expect that the strictest measures against corruption will continue to be enforced in all aspects of life in Singapore. Meritocracy, and not nepotism or patronage, underpins social mobility. With none but human resource as our only resource, maximum investment in education is the primary mechanism for “leveling the playing field of opportunity” in a Singapore run on strict principles of meritocracy.

10\.      When Singapore attained internal self-government in 1959, we inherited from the British an efficient but corrupt public service. Corruption was rife and permeated all sectors of society. Syndicated corruption was common especially among law enforcement officers.

11\.      Singapore is a successful example of an economy that experienced serious problems with rampant corruption, but was able to transform itself within one or two decades to the point where incidents of corruption are relatively rare. This was due in large part to the fact that we confronted corruption, especially in the public service, as a matter of urgency, and as a prelude to our economic growth and social development.

12\.      Moving more specifically to the factors that make for a corruption-free civil service, I would list seven factors and key anti-corruption initiatives. Broadly, these initiatives are not just concerned with countering corruption per se, but with reversing its negative impact on development and society as a whole. They make up what I call a National Integrity System.

**The 7 Components of a National Integrity System**
<ul>
  <li>Strong Political Will and Example of Political Leaders</li>
  <li>Public Service Characteristics and Ethos</li>
  <li>Reduced Opportunities and Incentives for Corruption: Administrative Measures to Increase Transparency and Predictability</li>
  <li>Changing the Way Government Does Its Business: Streamlining Operations to Improve Efficiency and Effectiveness</li>
  <li>Enhanced Likelihood of Detection: Institutional Capacity and Bureaucratic Independence of Anti-Corruption Agencies</li>
  <li>Swift and Severe Punishment</li>
  <li>Strong Public Support</li>
</ul>
I shall deal with each of these factors in turn, as they are so critical even for the future.

**A. Strong Political Will and Example of Political Leaders**

13\.      The People’s Action Party (PAP) came into power in 1959 on a strong anticorruption platform, at a time when the ordinary citizen had difficulties dealing with the abuses of the government then. “Stay clean: dismiss the venal” remains a key basic principle that guided, and continues to guide the PAP Government in office. The senior political leaders are willing to submit themselves to scrutiny over their honesty and integrity; showed leadership, conviction, commitment, stamina, and tenacity in fighting corruption; and demonstrated strong will to reject graft and political patronage. Personal example is critical in establishing the moral authority to root out corruption. It sets a climate of honesty and integrity. The Government has never hesitated to prosecute government ministers and civil servants at all levels for corruption. Incorruptibility remains a key prerequisite of legitimacy for anyone who aspires to political relevance in Singapore.

**B. Public Service Characteristics & Ethos**

14\.      Corruption by public servants is not to be tolerated at all costs, as this is tantamount to abusing the officer’s position as custodian and steward of public resources and public trust.

... *“Only by upholding the integrity of the administration can the economy work in a way which enables Singaporeans to clearly see the nexus between hard work and high rewards”* - Lee Kuan Yew (1979), then Prime Minister of Singapore

15\.      It is critical that Singapore have a clean and effective Public Service:
<ul>
  <li>Committed to the values of meritocracy and freedom from corruption and nepotism</li>
  <li>Judging effectiveness by results achieved through pragmatism and a sense of urgency</li>
  <li>Continuously driving for efficiency in execution which is responsive and economic</li>
</ul>
The test is not minimalist government, but effective government. In Singapore, effective government (high economic growth, improving welfare and social conditions, internal and external security) is invariably linked with the idea of clean government.

16\.      Meritocracy is important not “merely” because it ensures the best use of our human resources. Rather, meritocracy is a key part of our nation building efforts. Meritocracy sends out a signal that Singapore is for everyone. Talent and hard work, rather than connections and privilege, are the paths to success, and thus the rewards of success would be accessible to anyone according to his contributions. There us no room for “free-riders”.

17\.      Nepotism, the obverse of meritocracy, is corrosive of trust and confidence in the effectiveness and impartiality of public institutions, and gnaws away at the sense of public ownership which is so important to national consciousness. It distorts decision making by encouraging favouritism, and drags down efficiency both by putting incompetent people in public position, and by sapping the morale of the competent.

**C. Reduced Opportunities and Incentives for Corruption – Administrative Measures to Increase Transparency and Predictability**

18\.      This principle is straightforward: “Prevention is better than cure”. We ought to remove opportunity for corruption through clear work procedures and decision rules. And we should improve transparency and accountability wherever we can, so the public knows what they can expect, and may complain when they do not get it. Also, have clear rules in the government Instruction Manual on issues likes:

<ul>
  <li>Bullet 1</li>
  <li>Bullet 2</li>
  <li>Bullet 3</li>
</ul>

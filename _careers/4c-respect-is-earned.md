### **Chua Wee Yong**
#### **Principal Special Investigator**

While out with my wife at a shopping centre one weekend, I bumped into Peter*. Peter was happy to see me, and told me that he was now doing well, running a food business. I was glad for him. After that, we shook hands and parted amicably. You might think that Peter was a long-lost friend of mine. In fact, Peter was someone I had previously investigated and put behind bars. My wife was very surprised that there was no trace of animosity at all from Peter. 

**Respect is earned.** This is one key lesson Iâ€™ve learnt in my experience as an investigator.  During my interviews with Peter, I took the time to understand and build rapport with him. Most importantly, I treated him professionally and with respect, which eventually got him to open up about his offence and led to the solving of the case.

Eventually, seeing people turn over a new leaf and rebuild their lives honestly and for the better is very gratifying for me. Not many of us can say this but I feel proud to have done my job to maintain a corruption-free Singapore.

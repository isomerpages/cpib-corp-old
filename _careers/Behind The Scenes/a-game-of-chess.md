**Kogularam Naidu**<br>
**Deputy Head**

At CPIB, we're responsible for the investigation and prevention of corruption in Singapore. We want to keep Singapore corruption-free and ensure that offenders are brought to justice. This involves interviews with suspects in graft cases, field-work to uncover forensic evidence and, subsequently, taking offenders to task.

**A game of chess -** As an investigation officer, I’m always on my toes trying to figure out the various modus operandi of an individual, especially during an interview. Every interview is like a game of chess – you’re always thinking ahead of your opponents and calculating the possible moves they’ll make. It gets especially tricky when you deal with a repeat offender. They know that you’re on a fact-finding mission, and they’ll try various ways not to disclose information that might incriminate them.

I’m proud to be part of an elite group of graft-busters in Singapore.  I enjoy what I do, and I hope to carry on fighting corruption for as long as I can. I wish to keep corruption levels in Singapore low, as it helps our country maintain its high standards and reputation.

**Introduction**

In a globalised world where corruption can be transnational in nature, CPIB plays an active role in the international community’s fight against corruption. In this regard, CPIB participates in a number of international platforms which seek to bring together relevant stakeholders to tackle the global scourge of corruption. In addition to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) that forms the bedrock of our international engagement, CPIB represents Singapore at various fora such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Anti-Corruption and Transparency Experts’ Working Group (ACTWG), the Economic Crime Agencies Network (ECAN), the G20 Anti-Corruption Working Group (ACWG), International Association of Anti-Corruption authorities (IAACA) and the South East Asia - Parties Against Corruption (SEA-PAC) meetings between parties of a regional Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). Besides these, CPIB is a founding member of the International Anti-Corruption Coordination Centre (IACCC) which coordinates global law enforcement responses to allegations of grand corruption. CPIB also undertakes speaking engagements at regional and international capacity building seminars where we share Singapore’s anti-corruption experience. Basic information on the various anti-corruption platforms which CPIB is involved in may be found below.

**ADB/OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific**

In 1999, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) launched the ADB/OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific. 

There are currently 31 countries and jurisdictions of the Asia-Pacific which are party to the Initiative, including Singapore (represented by CPIB) which endorsed the Initiative’s Action Plan in November 2001. The Initiative supports member governments’ efforts to implement goals and standards for sustainable safeguards against corruption in the economic, political and social spheres through fostering policy dialogue, policy analysis and capacity building. As a member of the Initiative, CPIB attends Annual Steering Group Meetings held to discuss countries’ efforts to implement the Action Plan as well as the Initiative’s periodic Regional Conferences which gather policymakers, civil society and business sector representatives to assess progress and exchange ideas.

**APEC Anti-Corruption and Transparency Experts’ Working Group (ACTWG)**

The APEC Anti-Corruption and Transparency Experts' Task Force was formed in March 2005 to advise APEC Senior Officials in matters pertaining to the fight against corruption and the promotion of transparency, coordinate the implementation of the Santiago Commitment to Fight Corruption and Ensure Transparency, the APEC Course of Action on Fighting Corruption and Ensuring Transparency and the APEC Transparency Standards.  

It also promotes cooperation in areas such as extradition, legal assistance and judicial/law enforcement (especially asset forfeiture and recovery).  Recognizing the importance of its work, the ACT Task Force was upgraded in status to a Working Group in March 2011, and meets twice a year at the side-lines of the APEC Senior Officials’ Meeting (SOM).  It has also recently led to the establishment of the APEC Network of Anti-Corruption Authorities and Law Enforcement Agencies (ACT-NET), an informal network for sharing information and exchanging best practices and techniques among anti-corruption and law enforcement authorities in the Asia-Pacific region, to assist in detecting, investigating and prosecuting corruption, bribery, money laundering, and illicit trade.  Singapore, an APEC economy, is represented at the APEC ACT Working Group and ACT-NET meetings by CPIB.

**Economic Crime Agency Network (ECAN)**

Established in February 2013, ECAN is a formal network of law enforcement organisations involved primarily in the investigation and prosecution of economic crimes. CPIB is member of this Network, which includes 12 law enforcement agencies from various jurisdictions such as Australia, Canada, the European Union, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, the United Kingdom and the United States. CPIB regularly attends annual ECAN meetings and had hosted the Network’s second meeting in 2014.

**G20 Anti-Corruption Working Group (ACWG)**

The Group of Twenty or G20 is an international forum comprising of countries from 20 major economies. In 2010, G20 Leaders established the ACWG at the Toronto Summit in 2010 in recognition of the significant negative impact of corruption on economic growth, trade and development. Since 2010, the work of the ACWG has been guided by two-year action plans that include commitments by G20 countries to ratify and implement the United Nations Convention against Corruption, criminalise and prosecute foreign bribery, and cooperate with other countries to investigate, prosecute and return the proceeds of corruption. Singapore has been attending G20 meetings as a guest country since 2011 and in this regard, CPIB attends the G20 ACWG meetings which are usually held thrice a year.

**Introduction**

In a globalised world where corruption can be transnational in nature, CPIB plays an active role in the international community’s fight against corruption. In this regard, CPIB participates in a number of international platforms which seek to bring together relevant stakeholders to tackle the global scourge of corruption. In addition to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) that forms the bedrock of our international engagement, CPIB represents Singapore at various fora such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Anti-Corruption and Transparency Experts’ Working Group (ACTWG), the Economic Crime Agencies Network (ECAN), the G20 Anti-Corruption Working Group (ACWG), International Association of Anti-Corruption authorities (IAACA) and the South East Asia - Parties Against Corruption (SEA-PAC) meetings between parties of a regional Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). Besides these, CPIB is a founding member of the International Anti-Corruption Coordination Centre (IACCC) which coordinates global law enforcement responses to allegations of grand corruption. CPIB also undertakes speaking engagements at regional and international capacity building seminars where we share Singapore’s anti-corruption experience. Basic information on the various anti-corruption platforms which CPIB is involved in may be found below.

**ADB/OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific**

In 1999, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) launched the ADB/OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific. 

There are currently 31 countries and jurisdictions of the Asia-Pacific which are party to the Initiative, including Singapore (represented by CPIB) which endorsed the Initiative’s Action Plan in November 2001. The Initiative supports member governments’ efforts to implement goals and standards for sustainable safeguards against corruption in the economic, political and social spheres through fostering policy dialogue, policy analysis and capacity building. As a member of the Initiative, CPIB attends Annual Steering Group Meetings held to discuss countries’ efforts to implement the Action Plan as well as the Initiative’s periodic Regional Conferences which gather policymakers, civil society and business sector representatives to assess progress and exchange ideas.

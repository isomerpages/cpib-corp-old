We will continuously improve our systems, processes and services to achieve organisational excellence and meet customer expectations.

### **Our Service Commitment**

We aim to:

* Attend to 80% of visitors calling at the Bureau within 10 minutes from their appointment time.
* Answer 100% of calls to the Duty Officer line within 20 seconds. 
* Respond to enquiries made to the Quality Service Manager (QSM) within 3 working days for simple, clear-cut feedback and within 3 weeks for complex feedback*.

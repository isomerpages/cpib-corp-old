The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) is committed to providing quality service to our customers and stakeholders. This commitment is encapsulated in the CPIB Quality Policy.  

**Our Quality Policy**

We are committed to providing quality investigation and public outreach, towards achieving a corruption-free nation.

We will continuously improve our systems, processes and services to achieve organisational excellence and meet customer expectations.

**Our Service Commitment**

We aim to:

* Attend to 80% of visitors calling at the Bureau within 10 minutes from their appointment time.
* Answer 100% of calls to the Duty Officer line within 20 seconds. 
* Respond to enquiries made to the Quality Service Manager (QSM) within 3 working days for simple, clear-cut feedback and within 3 weeks for complex feedback*.

<p style="font-size:15px">* Complex feedback refers to those that require further study or fact-finding.</p>

### **The CPIB Flag**

The CPIB flag was commissioned in 2004 to further strengthen the Bureau’s identity.

The design of the CPIB flag is a horizontal bi-colour of white above red, with a CPIB logo emblazoned on the upper-left.

The upper white portion that carries the CPIB logo signifies the Bureau’s high standard of integrity and our role in keeping Singapore clean and corruption-free. The lower red portion represents CPIB’s role as a key state institution.

### **The CPIB Logo**

**The Square** is symbolic of Fairness and Equality. The cascade of the squares represents the pervasive effects of CPIB’s anti-corruption action.

**The Red Globe** represents the dot on top of the letter “I” within the logo’s typography which stands for CPIB’s vigilance and vision to be the world’s best anti-corruption agency.

**The State Colours of Red and White** are chosen as a reminder that combating corruption is an important national objective.

Headed by Director CPIB, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) has three main departments â€“ **Investigations, Operations and Corporate Affairs.**

**INVESTIGATIONS DEPARTMENT**

The Investigations Department executes the main function of the Bureau in investigating offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act. This department consists of three divisions: **Investigations Operations, Training Development & Policy, and Training Operations.**

The **Investigation Operations Division** consists of 5 investigation branches specialising in different areas. The **Special Investigations Branch (Public)** and **Special Investigations Branch (Private)** focus on corruption cases in the public sector and the private sector respectively while the **Financial Investigations Branch** conducts money laundering and transnational corruption investigations. The **General Investigations Branches** investigate the day-to-day corruption cases.

The **Training Development & Policy Division** reviews training and development policies of the Bureau and seeks to enhance the overall competency level of all CPIB officers. The Division also analyses corruption trends and is tasked with crafting investigative policies to address deficiencies uncovered in organisations during a corruption investigation.

The **Training Operations Division** is responsible for curriculum planning and conducting courses in corruption investigation.

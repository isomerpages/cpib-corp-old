		<p><b>1871</b></p>
		<p>Corruption thrived in Singapore during the colonial period as it was perceived that corrupt offenders were unlikely to be detected and punished. In 1871, corruption was made illegal. However, nothing concrete was done.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Diversify import sources – By diversifying our food sources, we reduce our reliance on any single source for any one food item. Should there be a disruption to any one source, Singapore is in a good position to work with our network of importers to tap on alternative food sources, and ensure that our food supply remains stable.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Grow local – Local production mitigates our reliance on imports and serves as a buffer in the event of a food supply disruption. SFA is supporting the growth of the local agri-food industry by developing spaces for farming, providing funding support, leveraging R&D, grooming local talent and rallying support for local produce.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Grow overseas – SFA supports Singapore companies to export urban food solutions to other countries so that they can overcome land and manpower constraints and break into new markets. These companies can then reap economies of scale and can also export food back to Singapore. Some local farms have ventured into Australia, Brunei, Hong Kong, Thailand and China.</p>

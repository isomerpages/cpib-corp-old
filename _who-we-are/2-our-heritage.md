		<p><b>1871</b></p>
		<p>Corruption thrived in Singapore during the colonial period as it was perceived that corrupt offenders were unlikely to be detected and punished. In 1871, corruption was made illegal. However, nothing concrete was done.</p>
		<p><img src="/images/heritage-1937.jpg" alt="heritage 1937"></p>
		<p><b>1937</b></p>
		<p>In December 1937, the first anti-corruption legislation was introduced with the enactment of the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance (POCO). The rationale for POCO was ‘the prevention of bribery and secret commissions in public and private business’. However, the British colonial government failed to curb corruption as POCO and the Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) under the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) were relatively ineffective. The POCO specified only three instances of corrupt behaviour and was a short document of 12 sections that were limited in scope. Moreover, corruption under the POCO was a non-seizable offence. Limited powers of investigation afforded by the POCO to investigation officers stifled their ability to effectively tackle corruption.</p>

		<p><b>1946</b></p>
		<p>The Prevention of Corruption Ordinance (POCO) was revised in 1946, making corrupt offences seizable, and giving police officers much wider powers of arrest, search and investigation to combat corruption. Nonetheless, the revised legislation could not make up for the fact that the Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) remained largely ineffective. The ACB’s responsibility to combat corruption was hampered by its limited manpower. Moreover, the ACB had to contend with other branches of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for resources. The principal reason for ACB’s inadequacies was its inability to curtail the prevalence of police corruption in colonial Singapore.</p>

		<p><b>1951</b></p>
		<p>In October 1951, a consignment of 1,800 pounds of opium worth $400,000 was hijacked at Punggol Beach and the robbers included three police detectives. A special team headed by officers of the Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) was appointed to investigate the case. Although some senior police officers were found to be involved in the hijacking, only one Assistant Superintendent was dismissed and another officer was retired. Due to ACB’s inability to garner sufficient evidence, the remaining officers were neither prosecuted nor convicted. As a result, in April 1952, the government brought together a Special Investigations Team comprising R Middleton-Smith, RB Corridon from Special Branch, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) BM Finch from the Courts and later Acting ASP Ho Kah Soon, also from Special Branch, to review the deficiencies in the ACB’s investigation of the opium heist.</p>

		<p><b>1952</b></p>
		<p>The Anti-Corruption Branch’s (ACB) failure to curb corruption appalled the colonial government and subsequently led to the ACB’s demise. The colonial government decided to retain the Special Investigations Team, resulting in the inception of the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau in September 1952 which came under the purview of the Attorney-General. Middleton-Smith assumed the position of Director of CPIB and he reported directly to the Colonial Secretary. The CPIB was a lean outfit of 13 officers as of October 1952, and its investigation officers were generally on short secondment to the Bureau. Then, the Bureau was located at the second-level of the Supreme Court Building at High Street. Middleton-Smith noted back then that the Bureau’s location at the Supreme Court would be of ‘psychological importance’ to the public, reinforcing the Bureau’s authority in the battle against corruption. Unfortunately, the officers’ short secondment and limited time and capacity to conduct thorough investigations undermined the effective operations of CPIB. There was also a social stigma of investigating fellow police officers. Thus, corruption, especially in its syndicated form amongst law enforcement officers, continued to thrive in the colonial society.</p>

		<p><b>1959</b></p>
		<p>The turning point came in 1959 when Singapore attained internal self-government. When founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew led his People’s Action Party (PAP) to take oath of office in June 1959, they wore the party uniforms of white-on-white which symbolise the purity and the incorruptibility of its members. The PAP-led government was committed to putting an end to corrupt practices in Singapore. The government was set to toughen existing legislation and to revamp CPIB into an agency devoted entirely to the investigation of corrupt practices and preparation of evidence to be used for prosecution. That year, the CPIB was transferred to the Ministry of Home Affairs.</p>

		<p><b>1871</b></p>
		<p>Corruption thrived in Singapore during the colonial period as it was perceived that corrupt offenders were unlikely to be detected and punished. In 1871, corruption was made illegal. However, nothing concrete was done.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Diversify import sources – By diversifying our food sources, we reduce our reliance on any single source for any one food item. Should there be a disruption to any one source, Singapore is in a good position to work with our network of importers to tap on alternative food sources, and ensure that our food supply remains stable.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Grow local – Local production mitigates our reliance on imports and serves as a buffer in the event of a food supply disruption. SFA is supporting the growth of the local agri-food industry by developing spaces for farming, providing funding support, leveraging R&D, grooming local talent and rallying support for local produce.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Grow overseas – SFA supports Singapore companies to export urban food solutions to other countries so that they can overcome land and manpower constraints and break into new markets. These companies can then reap economies of scale and can also export food back to Singapore. Some local farms have ventured into Australia, Brunei, Hong Kong, Thailand and China.</p>

	<input type="checkbox" id="title3"  /><label for="title3">Singapore's Food Story: Ensuring and Securing Food Supply</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Singapore imports more than 90 percent of our food. While Singapore has put in place strategies to secure our food supply, we operate in a global environment where we face a multitude of risks such as depleting natural resources, climate change, and unpredictable geopolitical and disease outbreak situations such as the ongoing COVID-19 situation. To mitigate and overcome these challenges, the collective efforts of the government, industry and public are required to strengthen our food supply resilience.</p>
		<p>SFA safeguards Singapore’s food supply through three food security strategies, known as the three “food baskets”:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Diversify import sources – By diversifying our food sources, we reduce our reliance on any single source for any one food item. Should there be a disruption to any one source, Singapore is in a good position to work with our network of importers to tap on alternative food sources, and ensure that our food supply remains stable.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Grow local – Local production mitigates our reliance on imports and serves as a buffer in the event of a food supply disruption. SFA is supporting the growth of the local agri-food industry by developing spaces for farming, providing funding support, leveraging R&D, grooming local talent and rallying support for local produce.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Grow overseas – SFA supports Singapore companies to export urban food solutions to other countries so that they can overcome land and manpower constraints and break into new markets.

	<input type="checkbox" id="title4"  /><label for="title4">"30 By 30" Local Production Goal</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>SFA aims to increase local production to achieve a goal of “30 by 30”, which is to produce 30% of Singapore’s nutritional needs locally by 2030, up from less than 10% today. Technology advancements will be key in unlocking the potential of our agri-food industry to ‘grow more with less’, in a sustainable manner.</p>
		<p>SFA is thus working with the agri-food industry and community to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Develop spaces for farming: To expand local food production, SFA tenders out spaces to agri-food companies with promising technologies through a competitive land tender basis.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Adopt innovative technologies: SFA provides strong funding support to the industry to adopt innovative technologies. This includes grants to co-fund co-funds farming systems to better control environmental variables and boost production capabilities.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Catalyse R&D innovation: R&D plays a key role to drive innovation and plug existing technological gaps. To support the “30 by 30” goal, research funding has been made available under the Singapore Food Story R&D programme to enable R&D in three areas –sustainable urban food production, future foods, and food safety science & innovation.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Groom local talent: As the agri-food industry grows and transforms, new and higher value jobs requiring  multi-disciplinary expertise in science, engineering, and info-communications will be needed. SFA is working with various Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and local farms on programmes such as diploma courses and structured internship programmes to equip students and adult job seekers with skillsets that will lead to meaningful, specialised careers in agriculture and aquaculture.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Rally support for local produce: As we ramp up local production, we will need the support of consumers to sustain a healthy and vibrant agri-food ecosystem. Local produce is safe, fresher, and lasts longer. Local produce also results in less spoilage, food waste, and a lower carbon footprint, as the produce does not need to travel for long periods of time before reaching the consumer. To make it easier for consumers to identify local produce, SFA has launched an “SG Fresh Produce” logo which can be found on the packaging of local produce in retail shops and supermarkets. By choosing locally produced food, all of us can play a part in enhancing Singapore’s food security.</p>

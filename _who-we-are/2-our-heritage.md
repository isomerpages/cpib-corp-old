		<p><b>1871</b></p>
		<p>Corruption thrived in Singapore during the colonial period as it was perceived that corrupt offenders were unlikely to be detected and punished. In 1871, corruption was made illegal. However, nothing concrete was done.</p>
		<p><img src="/images/heritage-1937.jpg" alt="heritage 1937"></p>
		<p><b>1937</b></p>
		<p>In December 1937, the first anti-corruption legislation was introduced with the enactment of the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance (POCO). The rationale for POCO was ‘the prevention of bribery and secret commissions in public and private business’. However, the British colonial government failed to curb corruption as POCO and the Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) under the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) were relatively ineffective. The POCO specified only three instances of corrupt behaviour and was a short document of 12 sections that were limited in scope. Moreover, corruption under the POCO was a non-seizable offence. Limited powers of investigation afforded by the POCO to investigation officers stifled their ability to effectively tackle corruption.</p>
		<p><img src="/images/heritage-1946.jpg" alt="heritage 1946"></p>
		<p><b>1946</b></p>
		<p>The Prevention of Corruption Ordinance (POCO) was revised in 1946, making corrupt offences seizable, and giving police officers much wider powers of arrest, search and investigation to combat corruption. Nonetheless, the revised legislation could not make up for the fact that the Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) remained largely ineffective. The ACB’s responsibility to combat corruption was hampered by its limited manpower. Moreover, the ACB had to contend with other branches of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for resources. The principal reason for ACB’s inadequacies was its inability to curtail the prevalence of police corruption in colonial Singapore.</p>
		<p><img src="/images/heritage-1951.jpg" alt="heritage 1951"></p>
		<p><b>1951</b></p>
		<p>In October 1951, a consignment of 1,800 pounds of opium worth $400,000 was hijacked at Punggol Beach and the robbers included three police detectives. A special team headed by officers of the Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) was appointed to investigate the case. Although some senior police officers were found to be involved in the hijacking, only one Assistant Superintendent was dismissed and another officer was retired. Due to ACB’s inability to garner sufficient evidence, the remaining officers were neither prosecuted nor convicted. As a result, in April 1952, the government brought together a Special Investigations Team comprising R Middleton-Smith, RB Corridon from Special Branch, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) BM Finch from the Courts and later Acting ASP Ho Kah Soon, also from Special Branch, to review the deficiencies in the ACB’s investigation of the opium heist.</p>

		<p><b>1952</b></p>
		<p>The Anti-Corruption Branch’s (ACB) failure to curb corruption appalled the colonial government and subsequently led to the ACB’s demise. The colonial government decided to retain the Special Investigations Team, resulting in the inception of the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau in September 1952 which came under the purview of the Attorney-General. Middleton-Smith assumed the position of Director of CPIB and he reported directly to the Colonial Secretary. The CPIB was a lean outfit of 13 officers as of October 1952, and its investigation officers were generally on short secondment to the Bureau. Then, the Bureau was located at the second-level of the Supreme Court Building at High Street. Middleton-Smith noted back then that the Bureau’s location at the Supreme Court would be of ‘psychological importance’ to the public, reinforcing the Bureau’s authority in the battle against corruption. Unfortunately, the officers’ short secondment and limited time and capacity to conduct thorough investigations undermined the effective operations of CPIB. There was also a social stigma of investigating fellow police officers. Thus, corruption, especially in its syndicated form amongst law enforcement officers, continued to thrive in the colonial society.</p>

		<p><b>1959</b></p>
		<p>The turning point came in 1959 when Singapore attained internal self-government. When founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew led his People’s Action Party (PAP) to take oath of office in June 1959, they wore the party uniforms of white-on-white which symbolise the purity and the incorruptibility of its members. The PAP-led government was committed to putting an end to corrupt practices in Singapore. The government was set to toughen existing legislation and to revamp CPIB into an agency devoted entirely to the investigation of corrupt practices and preparation of evidence to be used for prosecution. That year, the CPIB was transferred to the Ministry of Home Affairs.</p>
		<P><img src="/images/heritage-1960.jpg" alt="heritage 1960"></p>
		<p><b>1960</b></p>
		<p>The Prevention of Corruption Act, introduced by then-Minister for Home Affairs Ong Pang Boon, was enacted on 17 June 1960. This new legislative order incorporated significant provisions to eliminate the deficiencies of the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance (POCO) and to empower the CPIB to conduct its investigations and law enforcement duties. The PCA has since been revised several times to ensure its relevance and effectiveness, forming one of the key pillars in Singapore’s fight against corruption.</p>

		<p>CPIB was given its own office space in 1961, when it shifted to a 3-storey building at Stamford Road. This building was sited right next to the former National Library building and it remained CPIB's office for the next 23 years.</p>
		<P><img src="/images/heritage-1963.jpg" alt="heritage 1963"></p>
		<p><b>1963</b></p>
		<p>In 1963, the Bureau was placed under the purview of the Prime Minister’s Office, but was later transferred to the Attorney-General’s Chamber in 1965. The CPIB returned to the Prime Minister’s Office in 1969 and has since remained under the PMO.</p>

		<p><b>1968</b></p>
		<p>Illegal gambling was ubiquitous in Singapore in the 1960s. Apart from the problem of gambling, some law enforcement officers received bribes in exchange for protection not just to gambling syndicates but also to brothels, opium dens and traffickers. In a bid to bring these corrupt officers to justice, the CPIB carried out a joint operation, known as Operation Chap Ji Kee, with the Criminal Investigation Department. The term Chap Ji Kee means ’12 units’ in Hokkien, and was a local lottery popular among housewives. There were three main chap ji kee syndicates and CPIB had in 1968 targeted to first take down the biggest one, called Siu Poh Shanghai Tai Tong. This operation remained as one of the major operations CPIB has carried out to date, seeing a total of 67 police officers being implicated.</p>

		<p><b>1975</b></p>
		<p>A shocking case rocked the nation. It involved a senior political figure, the then-Minister of State for Environment, Wee Toon Boon. He was charged with corruption involving a sum of over $800,000. Wee was convicted and sentenced to four years and six months in jail. Upon appeal, the convictions were upheld but the sentence was reduced to 18 months. Wee’s conviction had much symbolic significance for the public; as it underscored the Government’s political will in eradicating corruption and CPIB’s resolute in executing this political will in an impartial manner.</p>

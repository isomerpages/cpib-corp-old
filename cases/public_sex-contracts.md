Peter Lim Sin Pang was the former commissioner of the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) who was investigated by the CPIB for corruptly obtained sexual gratification from two female vendors and one potential female vendor to the SCDF on 10 occasions between May 2010 and November 2011, as an inducement for showing favour by advancing the business interest of their companies with SCDF.

Its investigation revealed that on 2 May 2010, Lim obtained oral sex from a former senior employee of Nimrod Engineering at a public carpark. Ten months later on 17 March 2011, Lim tipped off her about a SCDF tender on radiation portal monitors before it was officially published on 6 April that year. Nimrod Engineering bade for the project shortly. Between May 2010 and November 2011, Lim had also obtained several sexual gratifications from two other women who were in senior positions for vendors of the SCDF. In return, Lim would show favour to the companies where the women were working at for IT-related tenders called by the SCDF.

Peter Lim Sin Pang was charged for corruptly obtaining sexual gratification involving three different women. In June 2013, he was sentenced to six monthsâ€™ imprisonment, and was officially dismissed from the public service on 31 August 2013.

On 3 June 2014, Port Inspector Sayri Mohamed Salleh (PI Sayri) from the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) was informed by his superior to investigate if a ship within Singapore’s port limits was carrying out gas freeing activities which is a potential breach of port regulations. PI Sayri proceeded to board the aforementioned ship to speak to the ship master, a Chinese national. Upon questioning, the ship master admitted to the breach and offered PI Sayri a white envelope containing US$50 to US$60 so that PI Sayri could drop the case and refrain from carrying further investigations. PI Sayri rejected the bribe and subsequently reported the matter to his superiors.

The case was subsequently referred by the MPA to the CPIB for further investigations, and the accused person was sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment on 4 September 2014 for corruption.

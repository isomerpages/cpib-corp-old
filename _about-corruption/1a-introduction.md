Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption, and the CPIB will not hesitate to bring corrupt offenders to Court, irrespective of status, creed or rank. Since independence, the Government was determined to take all necessary legislative measures to reduce the opportunities of corruption, and to deter and punish severely corrupt offenders.

The Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA) is the primary anti-corruption legislation in Singapore, and forms one of the key pillars in Singaporeâ€™s fight against corruption. The PCA provides the CPIB the powers to investigate corruption and other arrestable offences which are disclosed in the course of corruption investigation. Under the PCA, CPIB officers are also empowered to arrest, conduct a premise search or seize evidence without warrant if there is credible information or reasonable suspicion that a corruption offence has been committed.

The Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, Cap 65A (CDSA) works in tandem with the PCA by punishing the laundering of bribe money. The CDSA provides for the State to confiscate corrupt benefits.

The Penal Code (Sections 161 to 165) also contains provisions that deal specifically with the bribery of domestic public officers.

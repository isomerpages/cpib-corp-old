Agency Bail is administered individually by the various law enforcement agencies like the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) or the Singapore Police Force. This is different from Court Bail, which is only administered by the Courts when a person is charged in Court. More information on Court Bail can be found <a href="https://www.statecourts.gov.sg/cws/CriminalCase/Pages/Bail-matters.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.

### **What is Agency Bail?**

When a person is arrested (**Accused Person**) and is required to assist the Agency in further investigations, the Agency like the Bureau may grant Bail to the Accused Person. This means that if someone (**Surety**), is willing to provide security for the amount of money ordered by the Bureau for the Bail (**Bail Amount**), the Accused Person may be released from custody. Thereafter, the Surety has the obligation to ensure that the Accused Person reports to the Bureau as and when required. If the Accused Person fails to report at the Bureau, the Surety may lose the entire Bail Amount.

### **What type of security may be furnished?**

There is no need to present any security for Agency Bail except when the Accused Person is released on cash bail or personal bond. The quantum imposed by the Bureau is similar to the conditions imposed by the Court. Cashier’s order should be made out to “Accountant-General Department”.

### **Who can be a Surety?**

Any Singapore citizen or permanent resident above the age of 21 may be a Surety provided he or she is not a bankrupt and not facing criminal charges.

However, the Bureau has final discretion on whether to allow a person to be a Surety. For instance, the Bureau may not allow a person to be a Surety if the Bureau does not believe that he or she can or will ensure that the Accused Person reports to the Bureau accordingly.

### **Besides the Bail Amount, can the Bureau impose other conditions?**

The Bureau may impose similar conditions as stipulated by the Court.

To apply for permission to travel overseas or on any other queries, the Accused Person is required to write to the Bureau (before the next Reporting Date is scheduled to take place) with details of the next Reporting Date, the destination, duration of the trip and purpose of the trip.

### **How does a Surety bail an Accused Person?**

When the Bureau grants bail to an Accused Person, the Accused Person is usually allowed one phone call to inform his or her family member or friend of the Bail Amount and other conditions.

A person who is willing to act as a Surety for the Accused Person will have to report at the Bureau. The Bail Officer, Investigating Officer or any CPIO / CPIA will ensure that all the conditions of the Bail can be complied with and that the Surety (or Sureties, as the case may be) is briefed on his or her obligations as a Surety.

The staff issuing the Bail will also ascertain that the Surety is aware of the details of the Accused Person’s next Reporting Date.

CPIB’s staff may reject the Surety if the staff finds that he or she is not suitable to be a Surety for the Accused Person.

### **What if the Accused Person breaches the Bail?**

While an Accused Person is out on Bail and he or she does not report to the Bureau as required, a Police Gazette will be issued against him.

The Bureau will register a “Show Cause” case against the Surety at the State Courts. The entire Bail Amount which the Surety provided for the Bail may be forfeited by the Court except that, before the forfeiture, the Court will fix a date for the Surety to attend Court and explain why he or she failed to ensure that the Accused Person attend to the Bureau as required. In the absence of any compelling reason, the Court will order the forfeiture of the entire Bail Amount.

In the event that the forfeited Bail Amount is not paid by the Surety, an Order of Attachment against the Surety’s assets may be made by the Court. Should the sale of these assets be unable to satisfy the Bail Amount to be forfeited, the Surety may be imprisoned up to 12 months.

### **Can a Surety be discharged before the case against the Accused Person is concluded?**

The Surety may discharge himself before the case against the Accused Person is concluded.

If a Surety does not wish to continue being a Surety for the Accused Person, he or she must attend with the Accused Person at the next scheduled Bail Reporting Date and inform the Bail Officer or Case IO, the intention to be discharged as a Surety.

Alternatively, if the Surety does not wish to wait until the next scheduled Bail Reporting Date, he or she may write to the Bureau (attention to the Investigation Officer in charge of the case) informing of the intention to be discharged as the Surety and request for an earlier date to be fixed for him or her to report to the Bureau with the Accused.

The Accused shall arrange for another eligible Surety to be present during the Reporting Date.

However, if the Accused Person is unable to find a Surety or furnish Cash Bail, he or she will be produced before the Magistrate and may be remanded at the States Penitentiary until he or she is able to furnish bail.

### **How can the Surety obtain a refund of the Bail Amount when the case against the Accused Person is concluded?**

Not applicable for Agency Bail.

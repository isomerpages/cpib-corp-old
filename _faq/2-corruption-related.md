	<div class="accordion-content">
    <p>Broadly, corruption is receiving, asking for or giving any gratification to induce a person to do a favour with a corrupt intent. Therefore, it is not so straightforward without fully understanding the circumstances of the case, the individual facts and the intent of the parties involved. Each case must be assessed on its own merits to determine if it is a case of corruption. The act of giving a genuine gift (such as red packets) in itself without any corrupt intention is not considered corruption. However, if the gift is given secretly, or in a manner that attempts to avoid notice or attention with a view of securing personal special privilege or advantage and more so at the expense of  the recipient’s principal’s/employer’s interest (i.e. resulting in a compromise of the recipient’s official duties), it may be deemed to be corrupt and hence an offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act. In giving gifts, especially if it involved parties whom one may have an official relationship with, one may want to consider being upfront with the recipient’s boss and employer. This would improve transparency and at the same time allow the recipient’s employer to assess if the recipient could be held beholden to the gifts.</p>
    <p>Should you be in any doubt as to whether any particular transaction is corrupt, you can consult the CPIB Duty Officer at the CPIB HQ at 2 Lengkok Bahru, or the Corruption Reporting & Heritage Centre at 247 Whitley Road. Alternatively, you can call the Duty Officer at our hotline: 1800 – 3760000.</p>

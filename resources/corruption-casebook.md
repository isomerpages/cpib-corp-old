CPIB partnered with students from the Singapore Polytechnic Media, Arts & Design School, a journalist from the Straits Times and the Attorney-Generals Chambers on the 2nd book for teenagers entitled _The Corruption Casebook 2: Hidden Victims of Corruption_. This publication aims to educate our youth that corruption is not a victimless crime. The publication includes interactive activities, quizzes and a glossary, serving as a useful resource for the youth, their parents and educators.

Corruption has far-reaching consequences in various aspects of society. As part of CPIB’s prevention and outreach efforts, the CPIB has developed an e-Book titled "**The Corruption Casebook - Stories From Under The Table**" featuring stories on past cases of corruption. We hope it will be an interesting and insightful read, especially for our youth who may not have encountered corruption before.

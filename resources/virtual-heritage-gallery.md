The **CPIB Virtual Heritage Gallery** (VHG) is a web application that uses web Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies to create a 360-degree immersive tour of the VHG, with features such as a 3D model showcase of CPIB artefacts, interactive quizzes, case studies, and bite-sized multimedia contents.

The VHG not only provides an engaging learning experience for you, but also more convenience as you can visit the gallery anytime and anywhere as long as you have an internet device. This VHG was done in collaboration with students from Nanyang Polytechnic, School of Information Technology. The final-year students had a hand in bringing the idea to life by applying the knowledge and skills they had learnt in school.

You can sign up for the virtual gallery tour [here](/e-services/e-booking-for-learning-journey)

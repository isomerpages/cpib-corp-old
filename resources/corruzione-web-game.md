Corruzione is a Web Game that leverages on gamification to educate on the far-reaching consequences of corruption in a fun and interactive way. Through a restaurant simulation setting, players will have to face challenges and make decisions which emphasise the importance of honesty and integrity. Corruzione was co-created with students from Nanyang Polytechnicâ€™s School of Design and Media.

From a corruption-rife mudflat to a modern metropolis known for its efficiency and incorruptibility, the CPIB Exhibition “Declassified - Corruption Matters” provides insights into Singapore's battle against the venal. You will navigate with the exhibition as it showcases how corruption-ridden Singapore transformed itself into the glistening nation that now ranks among the least corrupt countries in the world. You will be re-acquainted with our Founding Prime Minister, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his vision in keeping Singapore corruption-free. You will plough through the declassified CPIB case archives, and read the stories of the Bureau’s investigation officers who rarely share their experiences.
 
The exhibition was held from 7 April to 22 May at the Plaza at National Library. From 2 June 2016, the exhibition will move to selected regional libraries. For more details, please click <a href="/press-room/events/cpib-exhibition-declassified-corruption-matters">here</a>.
